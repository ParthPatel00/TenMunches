Really loved the calm vibe, and the espresso. It was smooth, not burnt at all, strong and great tasting notes.\n\nCan\u2019t say enough good things, this place is solid and and I get why they have a perfect score.",

The service was friendly, helpful and fast. they offered a variety of drinks and pastries but you can also find souvenirs, magazines, tea, coffee, merchandise and more. The place is very spacious and has a few tables inside and an outdoor area. We order a golden iced kate and one iced chai latte. The drinks were flavorful without being overwhelming.All the right flavors were there, the pastries were also good.

They had SO MANY cool options for making coffee at home, which they also sell beans (that are collaboratively roasted) by the pound!

When we saw the long line, we knew it would be amazing. It did take a minute to get to order, but only because the folks in front were ordering pies (genius). When it was our turn, we ordered four slices, cheese, pepperoni, combo, and sausage.\nThe pepperoni has a hint of spicy that set it off completely. The cheese was cheesy and delicious. The sausage was tasty, but that COMBO ONE... by far the best one! It had a hint of sweet, spicy, and crunchy. Next time I am in SF, I will definitely be going back. It's worth the wait.",
          "For square pie, this place is solid. Their line can get long, though, so go early, place the order beforehand, or be prepared to wait. Their infamous Clam & Garlic was quite good! Not too clam-y and mainly garlic-y. Their other flavored pies are freshly made, not super but kind of dough-y, and delicious! It'd be a hit at any parties."

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the smell of fresh pizza and a visually striking interior. The experience was overwhelmingly positive, combining delicious food, quality ingredients, and a funky artistic decor that made the visit memorable. Yes, the price tag was a bit high (around $60 for our meal), but I left feeling it was absolutely worth it for the quality and overall experience. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my visit:\n- Pepperoni Pizza (Slice): Incredibly delicious, with a perfect thin crust that had a nice crunch on the outside and a chewy center. The pepperoni was savory and crispy around the edges, and you could taste the quality of the ingredients \u2013 from the tangy tomato sauce to the gooey, rich cheese. Each bite was bursting with flavor, and the slice was generous in size.\n- Meatball Sub: A hearty sandwich overflowing with tender, flavorful meatballs and melted cheese. The bread was toasted just right \u2013 crunchy on the outside but soft inside, soaking up the savory marinara sauce. It\u2019s the kind of comfort food that hits the spot; rich in flavor and clearly made with love and good ingredients.\nBoth items were freshly made to order and served hot. We could immediately tell the difference that quality ingredients make \u2013 nothing tasted processed or bland. For example, the tomato sauce on the pizza and sub had a homemade taste with herbs and natural sweetness, and the meats were lean and well-seasoned.",

I highly recommend it for locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe sign outside brought me in. For those of you who've seen Inside Out, do you remember the scene about broccoli pizza? Arizmendi inspired it. I came in for the pizza by the slice, but left with more goodies from their extensive and delicious bakery shelves. The breadsticks in particular are not to be missed. As for the pizza, you can get a palm-sized hot slice for $3.50. That's an excellent value for something so tasty. It was enough for a light lunch, but I could have easily bought two without breaking the bank. There's a parklet outside and some other benches to sit and eat. Golden Gate Park is about a 10-15 minute walk away if you'd like another option for a great picnic.\n\nArizmendi is a worker-owned cooperative (co-op), which also makes them stand out. You see it in the care that the worker-owners take in their goods, and in the assistance the front-of-house staff offer their customers. I'm very happy to support this unique and important business model.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Arizmendi Bakery the next time I'm on my way to the  Japanese Tea Garden, Botanical Garden, DeYoung Art Museum, the Cal Academy of Science, or anything else in the nearby area. Save a couple of broccoli slices for me \ud83d\ude0b",

          "We got the pumpkin muffins, the sourdough croissant, a pecan roll and a daily special pizza. The muffin was the only thing that was worth the wait in line. It was soft and sweet with little bits of sugar on top. The croissant had that bad sour chemical taste. The pecan roll had raises in it which threw off the taste and texture of what would have been a very tasty roll. The pizza was better than Costco but not more than double the price good.",
          "Arizmendi Bakery is a must-visit gem in San Francisco's Inner Sunset neighborhood near Golden Gate Park. I highly recommend it for locals and tourists alike.\n\nThe sign outside brought me in. For those of you who've seen Inside Out, do you remember the scene about broccoli pizza? Arizmendi inspired it. I came in for the pizza by the slice, but left with more goodies from their extensive and delicious bakery shelves. The breadsticks in particular are not to be missed. As for the pizza, you can get a palm-sized hot slice for $3.50. That's an excellent value for something so tasty. It was enough for a light lunch, but I could have easily bought two without breaking the bank. There's a parklet outside and some other benches to sit and eat. Golden Gate Park is about a 10-15 minute walk away if you'd like another option for a great picnic.\n\nArizmendi is a worker-owned cooperative (co-op), which also makes them stand out. You see it in the care that the worker-owners take in their goods, and in the assistance the front-of-house staff offer their customers. I'm very happy to support this unique and important business model.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Arizmendi Bakery the next time I'm on my way to the  Japanese Tea Garden, Botanical Garden, DeYoung Art Museum, the Cal Academy of Science, or anything else in the nearby area. Save a couple of broccoli slices for me \ud83d\ude0b",

            "text": "Napizza was the hit of our weekend trip to San Francisco. I'm really wishing it existed when I lived there! No question we'll be back next time we make it to the city. We went after seeing that a reviewer had the best chicken fettuccine alfredo they've ever had and from pictures of the pizza. We wanted to try both so we shared a pizza and the fettuccine. Both were fabulous! The Alfredo sauce has something extra special about it which indeed did make it the best we've ever had. The Neapolitan style pizza was extremely close to what you would find in the best pizza shops in Italy. This was the first time asking for a tiny bit of garlic to be added to a Neapolitan style pizza and it didn't come covered in it. Spot on! Great service too and it was a perfect day to sit outside. The blankets are a great touch. Only thing I would change would be to move the plant from behind the chair I was sitting in, it kept getting caught on my jacket.",

          "We had an amazing evening here. Our waiter Sara was the cutest ever, she and everyone else were so attentive and heartwarming. The pizza was really good and the tiramisu an absolute must-have, such a perfect ending of the day. Will come back here over and over!",
          "Lovely experience at 'Napizza. There was no wait, our waitress checked in on us multiple times while we were there, and the food was delicious! The music playing in the background was also really nice. The only complaint we had was the bottom of our pizza got wet incredibly fast (I'm assuming because of the mushrooms?) Definitely still worth a visit though, we will be coming back soon!",
          "We\u2019ve been to Napizza a few times and generally enjoyed the food \u2014 the pizza is consistently good and the pasta, while decent, isn\u2019t anything special.\n\nUnfortunately, our most recent visit will likely be our last. From the moment we walked in, the hostess gave off a strange, judgmental vibe that made the experience uncomfortable. The overly performative Italian chatter felt more forced than authentic, and it just added to an already awkward atmosphere. We also felt extremely rushed."

Caramelised onions and bacon added lots of flavour although it can get a little too salty on some bites. Portion was big and can actually get you full instead of a certain \"Double-double\" from the nearby chain. Perfectly priced too at $13.75.\n\nGarlic fries- The only people that shouldn't get this are people that are allergic to garlic. This is how Garlic Fries is done. The garlic sauce is made fresh and you can taste the spiciness of the fresh garlic yet it's mellow enough that you can enjoy its flavour. The fries were freshly fried and were real fluffy. They're good fries by itself but a whole new level with the garlic sauce. However, it would really be elevated if they can add a cheese component to it, whether it's sprinkled Parmesan or especially melted cheese. It would be AMAZING. Charge it at $8 and it'll still be a good deal.\n\nOverall- Very good burger and fries. Don't waste your time and money at In & Out. Can't wait to try their other food.",

The garlic fries were good and my peanut butter milkshake was delicious. Presentation was good and the service was great but lacks the space for seating comfortably.",

Went to Beep's last night around 11pm (love that they're open until 2am - perfect for late night cravings) and ordered their 1/2 pound burger well done with American cheese, avocado, and bacon plus fries. Holy cow, this might honestly be the best burger I've had in San Francisco. The patty was cooked perfectly - well done but still juicy somehow. The bacon was crispy, avocado was fresh, and everything just worked together so well. Even the fries were on point - crispy outside, fluffy inside. Yes, $25 for a burger and fries is pretty steep, but I'm not even mad about it because the quality was there. You can tell they use good ingredients and actually care about what they're putting out. The late hours are clutch too - there aren't many places doing quality food past midnight in the city. Staff was friendly even though it was late and they probably wanted to go home. If you're a burger lover, you need to check this place out. I'm already planning my next visit and trying to figure out what else on their menu is worth trying.

While I was lucky enough to get one of the 6 spots in the lot, that was only after I circled the block 3 times. Street parking was also not an option without an unreasonable amount of walking.\n\nMy one compliment about the burger is how well the done the milliard is. It is in the style of a lacy edge smash patty and imparts flaky bits of crispy beef to each bite. Other than that, it\u2019s just an average hamburger.\n\nThe garlic fries were a major let down. They smelled phenomenal and were heavily seasoned  with garlic and green onion but ate like stale, greasy cardboard. They sat in my stomach and were miserable.\n\nMaybe I just caught Beep\u2019s Burgers on an off day but because of my experience, I will not be giving them a second chance.",

Upon our arrival, however, we were informed that indoor dining was only available on weekends, leaving us with the outdoor seating option. Initially, we tried to remain optimistic and chose a table, but to our dismay, we were met with a strong smell of urine in that area. We quickly moved to another table, hoping for a better experience.\n\nNext, we attempted to place our order via the QR code, but the process proved frustratingly slow. After about 20 minutes, we still encountered issues with card payment, adding to our stress as we were on a tight schedule for medical appointments.\n\nTo make matters worse, our meals were served on disposable plates, bowls, and utensils\u2014something we hadn\u2019t anticipated based on the reviews we read. Regardless of whether these disposables were biodegradable, it detracted significantly from the dining experience. Eating from proper plates and using real cutlery enhances the enjoyment of a meal, and the use of disposables reminded me of the less favorable takeaway experiences during the pandemic. Thankfully, we always carry our own stainless steel chopstick set, which at least provided some comfort.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discuss the food itself. We ordered Bun Hue, stir-fried mixed vegetables, and Malaysian fried curry noodles. As someone from Malaysia, I was particularly looking forward to the curry noodles, but I was disappointed to find them overly saturated with coconut milk\u2014far from the authentic flavors I know. Both noodle dishes were excessively soggy, and the Bun Hue soup had a taste that was quite peculiar. The only redeeming dish was the mixed vegetables, which were nicely prepared.\n\nOverall, the experience felt more like dining in a national park without proper amenities, rather than enjoying a meal at a well-reviewed restaurant. It was disheartening to miss out on what could have been a wonderful dining experience in San Jose. \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15",

On the contrary, some of the items, if I was not told what they were, I would have not guessed they were vegan.\nI actually did not enjoy the desserts so I can't recommend them, but my favorite dishes that we tried were the Queens Joy, Spicy chacha (not actually that spicy), the crispy mushrooms and the caulipower. I would gladly go back for any of those dishes. The mango salad was also nice. Everything in general was yummy so you can't really go wrong.\nThe staff were very friendly and nice to us, even though we were a big group.\nI didn't get to take pictures of some of the dishes because our group ate them so fast.",

          "We walked for 30 minutes from our hotel, filled with high hopes for our meal at Vegetarian House Vegan, which boasted an impressive 4.6 rating on Google Reviews. Upon our arrival, however, we were informed that indoor dining was only available on weekends, leaving us with the outdoor seating option. Initially, we tried to remain optimistic and chose a table, but to our dismay, we were met with a strong smell of urine in that area. We quickly moved to another table, hoping for a better experience.\n\nNext, we attempted to place our order via the QR code, but the process proved frustratingly slow. After about 20 minutes, we still encountered issues with card payment, adding to our stress as we were on a tight schedule for medical appointments.\n\nTo make matters worse, our meals were served on disposable plates, bowls, and utensils\u2014something we hadn\u2019t anticipated based on the reviews we read. Regardless of whether these disposables were biodegradable, it detracted significantly from the dining experience. Eating from proper plates and using real cutlery enhances the enjoyment of a meal, and the use of disposables reminded me of the less favorable takeaway experiences during the pandemic. Thankfully, we always carry our own stainless steel chopstick set, which at least provided some comfort.\n\nNow, let\u2019s discuss the food itself. We ordered Bun Hue, stir-fried mixed vegetables, and Malaysian fried curry noodles. As someone from Malaysia, I was particularly looking forward to the curry noodles, but I was disappointed to find them overly saturated with coconut milk\u2014far from the authentic flavors I know. Both noodle dishes were excessively soggy, and the Bun Hue soup had a taste that was quite peculiar. The only redeeming dish was the mixed vegetables, which were nicely prepared.\n\nOverall, the experience felt more like dining in a national park without proper amenities, rather than enjoying a meal at a well-reviewed restaurant. It was disheartening to miss out on what could have been a wonderful dining experience in San Jose. \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude15",

          "Are you sure this is vegan? The chicken skewers were fantastic! The yucca fries with impossible beef was very flavorful.\nAnd the cake was so moist and just the right amount of sweetness. The owner was was a doll and made us feel right at home.",
          "Built up an appetite browsing through Ikea next door, then crossed into Saluhall, a hip eatery on mid-Market where Casa Borinque\u00f1a can be found. The Puerto Rican (PR) stand gave major island vibes and reminded me of the food I would find in Little Caribbean, NYC, but vegan.\n\nThe sample platter is the way to go with sweet BBQ skewers on a bed of rice and plantains. A PR meal wouldn\u2019t be complete without tostones, topped with your choice of chik\u2019n or beef. While you can get one of each, I have a slight preference for the chik\u2019n. Wash it down with a Malta India, a popular carbonated malt drink from PR. Despite its name or bottle shape, it\u2019s non-alcoholic. It was a nice touch that Casa Borinque\u00f1a carried this; it added to the meal.",
          "first time trying puerto rican food and it was amazing!!! ordered the sampler plate and everything was not only super worth it but incredibly tasty! it\u2019s the type of food that makes you say \u201ccan\u2019t believe it\u2019s vegan\u201d (but the best part is that it actually is). cashier was kind and service was quick. :]"

As we were walking to get in line (3 parties in front of us), 2 employees rudely pushed past us on the sidewalk. It was clear they were late as the bakery was supposed to open at 8 am but did not open until 8:15 am. We got the char siu croissant, ube croissant, pistachio blackberry croissant, and ginger pull apart. The char sui croissant is more like a Danish but a good alternative for people who like savory pastries. The ube croissant was ok - although the interior was pretty, I thought the ube flavor was lacking. The pistachio blackberry croissant has a nice tartness from the blackberry filling. The ginger pull apart was very unique and delicious - I really like ginger flavored things so I enjoyed it (this is more like real ginger flavor and not gingerbread). I would get all the pastries again except the ube croissant. Overall, I enjoyed the pastries but I think B Patisserie and Arsicault are still my favorite bakeries.",

            "text": "I love the food, no argument there. The only complaint is the service. Some of the cashiers are friendlier than the others. Also, there is no one fulfilling the orders, at least on the weekends. So, the cashier has to give you your order before getting to other people which makes a long wait. I would go back for the food, but not the vibe, unfortunately\u2026\n\nUpdate in July 2025:\nUnfortunately, the unfriendliness issue still persists. Quite frankly, I walked out of there today pretty bummed. I talk very highly of this place and the quality of their pastries. I second guessed myself today. I suggested to one of the cashiers to post a picture of their pasty options online, and they said \u201cyou can just take a picture\u201d. I just politely suggested it because as I told them, too, I didn\u2019t want to hold the line while deciding what to get. It was very rude of them to not take it and maybe just pretend they were open to feedback. So this is the only place for me to write a feedback on their customer service. I don\u2019t find myself as interested in their business as I used to be anymore and that\u2019s a shame. Fortunately, there are plenty of bakeries around here with new ones opening all the time.",

I came in for the pizza by the slice, but left with more goodies from their extensive and delicious bakery shelves. The breadsticks in particular are not to be missed. As for the pizza, you can get a palm-sized hot slice for $3.50. That's an excellent value for something so tasty. It was enough for a light lunch, but I could have easily bought two without breaking the bank. There's a parklet outside and some other benches to sit and eat. Golden Gate Park is about a 10-15 minute walk away if you'd like another option for a great picnic.\n\nArizmendi is a worker-owned cooperative (co-op), which also makes them stand out. You see it in the care that the worker-owners take in their goods, and in the assistance the front-of-house staff offer their customers. I'm very happy to support this unique and important business model.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Arizmendi Bakery the next time I'm on my way to the  Japanese Tea Garden, Botanical Garden, DeYoung Art Museum, the Cal Academy of Science, or anything else in the nearby area.

As for the pizza, you can get a palm-sized hot slice for $3.50. That's an excellent value for something so tasty. It was enough for a light lunch, but I could have easily bought two without breaking the bank. There's a parklet outside and some other benches to sit and eat. Golden Gate Park is about a 10-15 minute walk away if you'd like another option for a great picnic.\n\nArizmendi is a worker-owned cooperative (co-op), which also makes them stand out. You see it in the care that the worker-owners take in their goods, and in the assistance the front-of-house staff offer their customers. I'm very happy to support this unique and important business model.\n\nI can't wait to come back to Arizmendi Bakery the next time I'm on my way to the  Japanese Tea Garden, Botanical Garden, DeYoung Art Museum, the Cal Academy of Science, or anything else in the nearby area. Save a couple of broccoli slices for me \ud83d\ude0b",
          "I really like the corn cherry scones and bran muffins. Pizza is best when it\u2019s very fresh, so eat there or get a half bake and warm it at home. The cookies are quite chewy\u2014would prefer them slightly more tender but they are still fine. I also enjoyed a honey wheat bun here. Chocolate cake is decadent.\n\nBottom line is that this is a fine bakery that really knows how to put out good products."

But unfortunately, after trying their pastries, I was rather disappointed. Being a European myself, I have tried many traditional cakes and pastries in different countries, which gives me an understanding of the balance of their tastes and textures. From what I tried, the raspberry mousse cake only looked good, but the biscuit and mousse (not even similar to raspberry) were separate components that did not interact with each other. Puff pastry with cream was just sweet and very fatty, I think it would not hurt a little vanilla and some sour note. Also, this bakery lacks coffee and a place to sit and taste their goods, fully grab and go spot. Overall it\u2019s unlikely that I\u2019ll give them another try.",

I love their beautiful shop, but even before that, online ordering, pickup, communication, and customer service have always been efficient and easy. The icing on the cake (pun intended ;) is the yummy cakes and beautiful decoration. Our family likes to try new flavors from time to time, and they\u2019re always good. You won\u2019t be disappointed. Thanks, Butter& family.",

I personally enjoyed the pistachio & rose one more. I like the subtle rose aroma aftertaste. Note that the cake should be eaten at room temperature. The texture will be kinda like a more moist pound cake. Tbh the flavors weren\u2019t particularly surprising, but the texture of the cake and cream was incredible, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had anything quite like it before.",

          "Best cake ever. We order from butter& all the time. It has sort of become our tradition these past two years. The roast berries and sweet cream is so so good! The gluten free one version is very good too. I can attest that their black sesame and red bean and the sweet cream and roasted berries are simply the best (the photos don't do justice to how good the cake is). Take my word for it.",
          "This is my absolute favorite bakery in the bay area and the only one I will order celebratory cakes from. Their cakes have graced many, many family events both large and small. They are consistently of the highest standard, both incredibly delicious and beautiful. Their gluten free cake tastes just as good as their regular. I also have nothing but praise for the team, and with the myriad of orders and deliveries I've received there has never been one issue.",
          "We are so thrilled with our wedding cake from Butter& \u2026 a lot of research went into finding a cake that was healthier than your traditional wedding cakes, customizable and represented our timeless wedding theme. Butter& exceeded our expectations - our cake was so fresh, divinely tasting and we couldn\u2019t be happier. We ordered a mini cake as it was a small intimate wedding with family - and it was the perfect size. The house-made compote of pureed strawberries was amazing!!! wow wow wow! It did not disappoint. Highly recommend especially if you are looking for a healthier option that packs all the yummy flavor"

Bright, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it\u2019s one of the very few vegetarian dishes that leaves me totally satisfied without even thinking about meat. That says a lot.\n\nOf course, when I do indulge my carnivorous side, the pork chop is absolutely divine\u2014so tender it practically falls apart, and paired with buttery potatoes and the dreamiest mac and cheese. Rich, hearty, comforting. It\u2019s the kind of dish you crave long after the meal is over.\n\nThe escargot deserves a special shoutout\u2014it instantly transports me back to Paris. Delicately prepared, garlicky, and served with that unmistakable French flair. It\u2019s the real deal.\n\nAnd please, whatever you do, don\u2019t skip dessert. The Chaud is an experience. Warm, gooey chocolate topped with toasted marshmallows\u2014it\u2019s like being wrapped in a hug that somehow takes you straight to Brussels.

I ordered only one pancake, but it was good for two to share as it is quite thick. There is no tip, but the price is slightly on a higher side. Good quality brunch. I really liked the salsa in the egg Benedict and the home fry was very good with well roasted sweet garlics.",

          "Loved this place, feels like I'm in France every time. We enjoyed the special pancakes. Today's special pancakes where called the Miracle Pancakes (made with sour cream and poppy seeds). So good! The Crab Eggs Benedict had a good portion of fresh crab. Cannes scrambled eggs were flavorful. The Chicken apple sausage are delicious.\n\nSeating in the back patio. They have overhead heaters to keep you warm on a chilly day.\n\nService was outstanding!!!\n\nI would recommend a reservation  on the weekend.",
          "Zazie is hands down one of our Top 5 favorite restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area, and every visit reminds me exactly why.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s a big, big meat eater, I rarely go for a meatless option\u2014but the lemon ricotta ravioli here is in a league of its own. Bright, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious, it\u2019s one of the very few vegetarian dishes that leaves me totally satisfied without even thinking about meat. That says a lot.\n\nOf course, when I do indulge my carnivorous side, the pork chop is absolutely divine\u2014so tender it practically falls apart, and paired with buttery potatoes and the dreamiest mac and cheese. Rich, hearty, comforting. It\u2019s the kind of dish you crave long after the meal is over.\n\nThe escargot deserves a special shoutout\u2014it instantly transports me back to Paris. Delicately prepared, garlicky, and served with that unmistakable French flair. It\u2019s the real deal.\n\nAnd please, whatever you do, don\u2019t skip dessert. The Chaud is an experience. Warm, gooey chocolate topped with toasted marshmallows\u2014it\u2019s like being wrapped in a hug that somehow takes you straight to Brussels. Yum, yum, YUM!\n\nZazie isn\u2019t just a meal\u2014it\u2019s a mood, a memory, and a masterpiece every time.

            "text": "Went to Eight AM for brunch based on their exceptional reviews (4.6 at the time), and honestly\u2026 it felt pretty overrated. The overall vibe was chill and the staff was friendly, but the food didn\u2019t live up to the hype \u2014 very mediocre and definitely overpriced in my opinion.\n\nWe ordered the Egg Frittata, Nutella Crepes, Waffle, and the Avocado Toast Sampler. The frittata came with house fries and fruit, and while it was decent, it didn\u2019t feel like it was worth $22. The avocado toast sampler was especially disappointing \u2014 $30 for what was basically plain avocado spread on toast, topped with tomato, mozzarella, and a balsamic drizzle. It had almost no flavor, and definitely didn\u2019t justify the price tag.\n\nThe latte was just okay \u2014 nothing special \u2014 and same goes for the crepes and waffles. Not bad, but nothing memorable either.\n\nOne annoying surprise: they automatically added a 20% gratuity, which they claim is for parties over 4 \u2014 that\u2019s fine, but it really should be clearly mentioned somewhere on the menu or told upfront. I always tip anyway, but it\u2019s the lack of transparency that was frustrating.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a cute spot with a relaxed atmosphere, but the food was underwhelming and overpriced. Giving 3 stars because it wasn\u2019t bad, just really average and not worth the hype or cost. Wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to return.",

Although we found several great dinners for breakfast during our stay I have to say without a doubt this was my favorite. The food and people were excellent however, the fruit was so amazing from the presentation to the taste. They were very busy for a Monday morning, there was a wait to be seated. That\u2019s always a good sign so we ate outside since the sun was out, it wasn\u2019t too bad. If they\u2019re too busy they own the dinner a few doors down so you could try that one. I noticed several employees at each location so I had to ask. They said they were a little different, one has a license to serve alcohol is the main difference. Great job, love to support small local family businesses as we are small businesses owners back in Ohio. Thanks again",

The cozy atmosphere and beautiful wooden tables made it feel like a true Turkish home.\n\nHighly recommend Lokma for anyone craving a vibrant and hearty breakfast it's truly one of the best breakfast experiences I've had in the Bay Area!\n\nFavorite bites:\n\nSucuklu Yumurta (Turkish sausage with scrambled eggs)\n\nSpinach B\u00f6rek\n\nHomemade jams and olives\n\nThank you, Lokma team -- can't wait to come back!",

          "Reasonable portion sizes \u2014 not too much! Grilled chicken was very tender and flavorful but the halibut dish was even better. I would recommend the dips & pita as well; baba ganoush spread was my favorite.",
          "The halibut was DIVINE. Start your course with the hummus and pita. Get the chicken or halibut and end your meal with the baklava with ice cream. You will not be disappointed.\n\nOne of my favorite San Francisco spots to eat at, brunch or dinner, especially as the sun sets.",
          "This restaurant is a fantastic place to enjoy a meal. Although parking was challenging, the food, atmosphere, and attentive staff made my experience truly enjoyable. I will definitely revisit this place if I'm in the area. The beet appetizer was particularly flavorful, featuring an unexpected combination of fruit and vegetables. The Branzino, a Mediterranean sea bass, was cooked to perfection. Its delicious white fish meat was undoubtedly the highlight of the evening."

          "Delicious, quality fish and reasonably priced. I'd eat that California roll every day if I lived nearby. I don't know if there's a better $11 dish in the city.\n\nWe ate a bunch of fish and had a few sides. Service was great. I would definitely come back.",
          "Cozy hole-in-the-wall sushi joint an industri-chic feel and plenty of options for a shareable meal.\n\nFavorite roll had to be the Fresca \u2014 ceviche with pineapple and avocado \u2014 though Tango was a close second. Some of the salmon was extra \u201cfishy\u201d tasting, which wasn\u2019t a dealbreaker but perhaps could\u2019ve been a bit more fresh.\n\nStandout of the meal was actually from the daily menu \u2014 local firm tofu with crunchy garlic oil. WOW, it was delicious! The chilled tofu with the spicy sauce made for a really unique and enjoyable dish.\n\nService was great and friendly, and we had no problem being accommodated as walk-ins. Worth checking out!"

            "text": "I really wanted to love Zentarou, but unfortunately, it missed the mark for me and my partner. We visited during Valentine's weekend (though not on the actual day) and opted for the Valentine's omakase special (which seemed to be the equivalent of their premium omakase, but dressed up for the occasion). At $280 for two people, we had high expectations but felt that the quality and service didn\u2019t quite justify the price.\n\nOur favorites were the Miyazaki A5 wagyu, Otoro, and Hokkaido uni. These were included in the Valentine's special (and also appear to be part of the premium omakase set on a regular night). For the regular omakase, these items are available as supplements. The second round of nigiri was probably the best part of the meal.\n\nHowever, beyond those highlights, the rest of the experience fell short. The rice ratio and flavor on the first round of nigiri were inconsistent, and the hamachi tasted slightly overcooked. When asked about allergies and food restrictions, I specifically requested no cucumber, yet the first dish included it. The eggplant in that same dish was also tougher than expected. While we tried to keep an open mind, we couldn\u2019t help but feel that the overall quality didn\u2019t match the price tag.\n\nThat said, we appreciated the presentation of the dishes and the effort of the team. While the staff was friendly, they seemed a bit rushed (likely due to the busy weekend), which made the service feel less personal than we had hoped for. Perhaps it was just an off night due to the occasion, but given our experience, we\u2019d be hesitant to return. At this price point, I believe there are better omakase experiences to be found.",

We've been to hole in the walls to Michelin starred restaurants, and this place has topped all of those experiences. You can see how much Chef Julio loves/enjoys his craft. He took his time to explain each dish in detail. Obviously, I was drunk with endorphins with each bite that I don't remember the names of all the pieces that we were pampered with. I did remember that each piece had different layers of flavors that never overpowered each other. They perfectly fused together in harmony. I overheard another patron say he just returned from Japan, and this place beats the quality there. I personally can't confirm that, but I can seriously say my wife enjoyed it so much. She told me we're ONLY coming back here for Omakase and nowhere else. Thank you, Chef, and see you again soon.",

Totally different vibe - cool, dark interiors, with a very intimate feel. Love the decor.\nService was on point.\n\nCocktails were okay, but the sake was incredible!\nFor appetisers we tried the beef kimchi dumplings (so good!), beet and burrata salad (delicious) and eggplant tempura (must try!).\n\nAll the three rolls were fantastic but my favorite was the dragon roll. I\u2019d highly recommend.\n\nWe tried the cod which was good, but not something I\u2019d get against.

Some of the highlights include the Hokkaido uni with caviar, wagyu with shaved foie gras, Seabream, snapper, ocean trout and tuna belly. We loved every bite. You are given a price range of $109-$209 I believe and they tailor the menu for you. The portion of rice to fish was perfect and there is a large selection of sake and wine. You can do a sake tasting for $75 or get bottles and glasses. The service was great, an empty plate was almost never on our table and the meal came out well paced. Reservations can be made 6 weeks in advance via resy and the sushi bar is most popular. Highly recommend this place for a wonderful omakase experience.",

            "text": "This place is the biggest scam for anything omakase. TO START, they ADD additions/charges to your meal without telling you so when the bill comes it\u2019s a massive surprise (who does that?!) and it\u2019s $200PP already!! Truly such a disappointment. They give you plain noodles as one of the omakase! NOODLES W NOTHING! and tobiko size smaller than my pinky nail ON A POTATO CHIP! A POTATO CHIP!  There is so much fresher, better and cheaper omakase in SF for way less than $200 PP. this place would make anyone from Japan sick to their stomach. Save yourself your hard earned money. Did I mention it\u2019s $200 per person and you get potato chip??",

          "as someone who has had amazing omakase in japan, this place is just below the best i've had in japan, for slightly higher cost.  still worth 5 stars in my opinion.  they take risks with creative fusion takes, and the vast majority are great. interesting sake selection, the sake flight was a great journey with unexpected finds.  great presentation, good vibes and attentive staff.\n\nfirst, book the sushi bar for the best experience, talk to the chefs, ask about the ingredients.\n\nsecond, set your own budget.  the chef was very up front with us and had us set how much we were willing to spend, and you can add more as you get closer to the end.\n\nthird, come with an open and adventurous mind.  try everything that you're not allergic to.",
          "This place is phenomenal. One of my favorite omakase experiences. Dinner came with 21 different pieces and a dessert. Some of the highlights include the Hokkaido uni with caviar, wagyu with shaved foie gras, Seabream, snapper, ocean trout and tuna belly. We loved every bite. You are given a price range of $109-$209 I believe and they tailor the menu for you. The portion of rice to fish was perfect and there is a large selection of sake and wine. You can do a sake tasting for $75 or get bottles and glasses. The service was great, an empty plate was almost never on our table and the meal came out well paced. Reservations can be made 6 weeks in advance via resy and the sushi bar is most popular. Highly recommend this place for a wonderful omakase experience.",

Regarding the price/quality, very reasonable. The only negative thing to mention, which is not related to the restaurant, is the fact that the neighborhood is full of people struggling with drug adiction in the streets.

My phone was running out of battery in their restaurant and the server lady charged it for me using their outlet!\n\nThe only con would be the location because this restaurant sits on where there are many homeless people. We were walking there and it was our first time walking in San Francisco so it was a little scary.",
          "This was my first time here and the food was very very good! It's definitely in a sketchy area, but worth it! Go with a big group so you can try many different dishes. I wanted to try more. It's recommended and I would return!",
          "Very authentic thai restaurant in the heart of SFO! We ended up here as suggested by a thai lady we met in a caf\u00e9. She suggesed Zen Yai as a genuine thai restaurant. Totally true! We ordered the sausage, papaya salad, cashew nut, pad thai and pad krapao ( last two not shown in the pictures). Everything was delicious. The waiters were very friendly. Regarding the price/quality, very reasonable. The only negative thing to mention, which is not related to the restaurant, is the fact that the neighborhood is full of people struggling with drug adiction in the streets. It is a bit shocking to see and if you come from abroad like us that we come from Europe, it was sad and confronting to see."

Excellent.\n\nNow my wife is, I would say, a thai food enthusiast. I'm not sure it's her main passion, but she could probably get a PhD in loving Thai food.\n\nThis is her fourth favorite Thai food, in San Francisco. That is very high praise. When asked, she said she would eat here again, which my wife if she doesn't like the Thai food she will never go back to the city that the Thai food was made in.\n\nShe had the drunken noodle.

          "We spent over six weeks in Thailand in January and February this year and we ate well!! So trying to find an authentic Thai restaurant, we decided to give this a try! We\u2019re so glad we did as we felt that there flavors and taste were so reminiscent of all the food we ate  at very local restaurants and vendors in Southern Thailand as well as Chiang Mai.\n\nWe ordered green curry with chicken and the chicken pad Thai. We also ordered brown rice. The food was perfect and brought us back to our time earlier this year in Thailand.\n\nWe coming back to try many different dishes in their menu!! Also service was excellent!!",
          "This is excellent Thai food.\n\nWe started the meal with the gyoza in red curry sauce. Very tasty. Crispy and hot.\n\nFor lunch the wife had the drunken noodle and I had the pad Thai with shrimp. My pad Thai was very solid, just exactly how you expect it. Excellent.\n\nNow my wife is, I would say, a thai food enthusiast. I'm not sure it's her main passion, but she could probably get a PhD in loving Thai food.\n\nThis is her fourth favorite Thai food, in San Francisco. That is very high praise. When asked, she said she would eat here again, which my wife if she doesn't like the Thai food she will never go back to the city that the Thai food was made in.\n\nShe had the drunken noodle. She said it was a classic drunken noodle and very good.\n\nWe had two Thai iced teas and that was it. I'm very much recommend if you're in the neighborhood.",
          "Smallish Thai place with some fun unique offerings. They had a Thai omurice and a beef curry I had not seen at many other places.\n\nI think their seasoning leaned a bit too sweet for my liking and their fried rice was just okay.\n\nStaff was pretty busy at the time and so were not super attentive and got our order wrong. But they were super nice about fixing it.\n\nWould probably go back to try their curry fried rice and appetizers."

The duck is top-notch: beautifully roasted, shiny and crispy skin, and not overly fatty, which makes it even better. It\u2019s served with soft pancakes, green onions, cucumber, and even a small dish of sugar. I was curious about the sugar until I overheard the table next to me dipping the duck skin in it is game changer!\n\nThe quality is excellent, and while you might find cheaper Peking duck elsewhere, the flavor and texture here make it well worth the price. We also ordered the Chicken with Explosive Chili Pepper, which featured a generous amount of Szechuan chili peppers. It delivered that classic mouth-numbing sensation, but in a perfectly balanced way not overwhelming at all. The fried chicken pieces were seasoned perfectly and packed with flavor.\n\nOn top of the amazing food, the service stood out. Even though the place was busy, one of the servers took the time to explain the dish\u2019s origin and the best way to enjoy it, which made the whole experience even more special.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone craving authentic Chinese flavors especially the duck. A must-visit when in SF!",

The dish I was disappointed was \u201c Couple\u2019s Delight\u201d, which was too salty and sour. For the full Peking duck, they didn\u2019t serve the duck bone. From other restaurant, we usually also got deep fried duck bone with garlic salt pepper powder, or duck bone soup without extra charges.",

            "text": "Upon arrival our party realized we made a reservation at the other Z&Y. However, the host was able to help us out and get us seated as quickly as possible before the kitchen took their last orders.\n\nThe presentation of the food was attractive. Some of the standout dishes were the stir-fried crab, cumin lamb and the almond cream dessert. Loved how the crab & lamb were just sizzling on the hot plate when they came out! The soup dumplings were also a solid order with awesome texture and flavor, but the cumin lamb was my favorite. If you can handle lots of Szechuan peppers then you\u2019ll love the crab as it\u2019s quite numbing. The mung bean flour noodle in that dish was the intriguing part for me with their unique texture and color.\n\nThere were subtle areas of service that could be improved. For example, leaving the bottle of water on table so that we didn\u2019t have empty glasses. Secondly, there was a server that was rushing to drop the hot plate for the crab and spilled our sauce for soup dumplings. Other than that they were efficient and gave us great recommendations and stayed on top of waters for most of the dinner.\n\nOur favorite part of the experience was our server, Jake! He had told us he opened the location and was at the other Z&Y for 10 years. Jake was great with recommendations and had a fun sense of humor ;) He let us see and use his POS, as we were needing out since we\u2019re all hospitality professionals. He introduced us to Chef Han, and we had an awesome time getting to know him and learn about his journey. It was a memorable experience, and well definitely be back for the Peking Duck!",

          "Had a fantastic meal at Z&Y Peking Duck!! Ordered the whole duck in advance when we made the reservation. Ling was a really great server and attentive! Also got the pork belly with preserved greens, spicy duck blood, and green beans - all delicious! Finished with the almond curd which was adorable and tasty, but not too sweet. Would definitely come back!",
          "Z&Y Restaurant is hands down one of the best spots in San Francisco for Peking duck but make sure you call ahead and reserve your duck because they do run out, and it\u2019s their star dish for a reason. The duck is top-notch: beautifully roasted, shiny and crispy skin, and not overly fatty, which makes it even better. It\u2019s served with soft pancakes, green onions, cucumber, and even a small dish of sugar. I was curious about the sugar until I overheard the table next to me dipping the duck skin in it is game changer!\n\nThe quality is excellent, and while you might find cheaper Peking duck elsewhere, the flavor and texture here make it well worth the price. We also ordered the Chicken with Explosive Chili Pepper, which featured a generous amount of Szechuan chili peppers. It delivered that classic mouth-numbing sensation, but in a perfectly balanced way not overwhelming at all. The fried chicken pieces were seasoned perfectly and packed with flavor.\n\nOn top of the amazing food, the service stood out. Even though the place was busy, one of the servers took the time to explain the dish\u2019s origin and the best way to enjoy it, which made the whole experience even more special.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone craving authentic Chinese flavors especially the duck. A must-visit when in SF!",

My favorite of the dumplings. Preferred them over the xiao long bao.\n\nNumb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Bao \u2013 Despite the name, there was no numbing spice at all. Ended up giving them a generous pour of chili oil.

The sauce on those wings are chef\u2019s kiss! The black bean noodles had a bit of beef, shrimp, and squid in it.

The atmosphere inside was lively and a bit loud, but judging by the crowd both waiting outside and dining in, it's clear the food is well-loved.\n\nWe ordered the original dry fried chicken wings, which were delicious. They were perfectly crispy with a sweet and spicy flavor. I noticed that when you take them to go and reheat them, the spice comes through even more.\n\nWe also tried the dry black bean sauce noodles, and they really stood out. The flavor was bold and intense in the best way, and the dish was loaded with seafood like shrimp, calamari, and scallops. I really liked it.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience and definitely worth the wait.",

Overall very impressed with their execution of chinese American classics, the flavors are top notch.",

The Xiao long bao came with its own cookie container making it easy to enjoy. The Siu Yak (pork Belly) was wonderful. The skin was ultra crispy. The mustard with it was sharp and added to the wholeness of the dish. The beans with the pork mince were absolutely delightful. The beans were crisp, salty and yum. Could survive on them. The signature beef was tender but too sweet for my liking. The seafood fried rice could be a whole meal and didn\u2019t need anything else with it. The restaurant is large and can be a bit noisy, but that added to the atmosphere. Should have gone with a larger group so that could have sampled more of the menu. Will be back.",

As an Indian, I hold a super high bar for Indian food in town and can vouch for this restaurant being authentic hands down. Was so happy to see the gigantic Mysore Dosa (typically similar size back home). The chutney and Rasam soup were incredible, and the potato feeling was just perfect - not too wet / nor cooked with too much spices. The Tandoor pomfret was actually pomfret as compared to most restaurants serving you Pompano fish. I think the fish could've been marinated for longer, but the taste of the tandoor and the fish were so fresh. My friends and I absolutely loved the food. The owners are super kind and checkin on you to see if they can make your food experience any more comfortable. The service was quick and all of the ingredients were super fresh. A solid 9.5/10 for me. Definitely stopping by again!",

The main chef is from Karur and another chef from Tanjavur. Their sambar was fresh and authentic. We had medu vada which was made fresh as opposed to refried. We had the paneer burji dosa which my son loved and I had the Mysore masala dosa. The coconut chutney was a little water for my taste. He also offered additional chutney. The fresh hot papad in the beginning was very nice!  If you are in the area highly recommend it. There seems to be decent amount of street parking nearby but it is paid parking since it is SF!",

So what's the difference - it is how Nepalese food is made. I tried the Spinach chicken and I can totally feel authentic Nepalese taste. More turmeric, slightly higher salt, super soft chicken likely cooked in cooker with more liquidy gravy topped with generous amount of cilantro. All very typical of Nepalese style of cooking.\n\nEven the Mango Lassi was pretty solid - felt fresh and not going sour whatsoever.\n\nIf there was anything which was a little underwhelming - it was the Aloo Paratha. It was good but it was made like Bihari/Nepali style. If you are expecting Punjabi style paratha - you will be disappointed.\n\nAmbience is ordinary but given the place is located in SF downtown, I won't complain.",

We bring our visitors here and when they come back to the city they always request to go again. If you\u2019re looking for your new local favorite, Cuisine of Nepal will not disappoint.",
          "The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is very cozy. The owner came and talked to us and offered us free wine as it was our first time in. Service is excellent. Highly, highly recommend!",
          "Both the food and the hospitality at this lovely restaurant are amazing. I am absolutely thrilled that Cuisine of Nepal is back open, and it is just as wonderful as it has always been. I love the momos and the spicy sauce served with them. My favorite entree is the Tofu Takari - everything I\u2019ve tried there has been great, though, so lots of great options. One of my favorite restaurants in the city - highly recommend!"

I order the mole. Should have known when I ordered that from a order and pay and then  go or sit down. I've had over 100 different mole dishes and some very impressive ones at that.

The staff is prepping for the busy day ahead, it is only about 11am, carbe asada is being chopped, stews are all full to the brim, I get excited wanting to try everything eventually - maybe even today. But the burrito is a sad burrito, none of the components have flavor, and no amount of, frankly, pretty mild salsa, can fix the lack of oomph in the rice, beans, guac and chile itself.\nStill a beautiful corner still beautiful murals, hard working and lovely staff, but a regrettable burrito.",

The Special Taco with carne asada was a decent size and portion, a generous layer of greens and cheese on top. The Suiza Quesadilla with carnitas is more than enough for one person, it\u2019s a sizeable amount and loaded with delicious cheese and other toppings. This location is really busy during the dinner rush and you will often see the lines running out the door. There are some tables and chairs indoors but not enough to accommodate everyone in line. Fortunately, there\u2019s a mix of \u201chere\u201d and \u201cto-go\u201d orders so the number of available seats remains enough.",

The ingredients are fresh, authentic, and always pair well together. I personally prefer their burritos - they pack plenty of meat inside and provide ample salsa when asked. They also include chips and salsa for free with tacos and burritos, something that's becoming a rarity in San Francisco. Stop by whenever you get a chance - this place deserves it!",

          "We got an Al pastor wet burrito which they very kindly split in half. The burrito was bland and didn\u2019t have a lot of flavor. After dousing it with their sausage, we still found it to need more flavoring. The atmosphere was chaos as there were kids running amuck everywhere and we couldn\u2019t hear each other speak!!",
          "Memorable corner of my youth. Always been a taqueria someone or other chooses over the ones that I preferred. Ten years later, this corner is convenient and it is one of those days that \u201chere & now\u201d is more important than \u201cthere & better\u201d. Ordered a Chile Relleno burrito. The staff is prepping for the busy day ahead, it is only about 11am, carbe asada is being chopped, stews are all full to the brim, I get excited wanting to try everything eventually - maybe even today. But the burrito is a sad burrito, none of the components have flavor, and no amount of, frankly, pretty mild salsa, can fix the lack of oomph in the rice, beans, guac and chile itself.\nStill a beautiful corner still beautiful murals, hard working and lovely staff, but a regrettable burrito.",

As I arrived, the small tables for two people were filling up very quickly. Luckily I got seated right away. After 6PM, you need to wait in line, so I highly suggest to come here 5 to 6 PM. Yes it is early for dinner unless you don't mind to wait. To me, I hate waiting. Lol. I ordered B2 which was Premium Kalbijjim with regular size. This portion definitely can fill up more than 2 people. I also added extra rice cake and cheese. Both add-ons were 11 bucks. The cheese itself seemed  to be worth it, but not for the extra rice cake. I counted the total and it was like 10 pcs, so basically a handful.  The short rib was well tender and cooked. The services were on point and efficient. As soon as we were done, we paid and left because I didn't want others to wait too long. I suggest you do the same and don't sit and chat after you finished eating. It's a common courtesy. I also recommend to park at the Jtown plaza because street parking spaces are limited due to high volume of cars. I definitely come back to try other food on the menu like Seolleong Tang and Mandu Guk. Big fan. Keep up the good work!",

There was a bit of a wait, nothing to crazy, it\u2019s a cute little space. The bbq short ribs are honestly to die for, I was so SO impressed. They are marinated amazing and cooked over the fire, they are so tender with an amazing char on them. We got a sizzling plate half bbq ribs, and the bulgogi beef (which was also amazing). The tofu soup was so hearty, flavourful, and warm. I ate it over rice and got the beef one. The gyoza were good, nothing special, but still good. The reviews are all accurate about this place, service was amazing and the food came out fast. Will be back next time I visit SFO.",

The store has welcoming lighting and thoughtful signage explaining various foods and traditions. There are a lot of shoppers, but the aisles are wide so it never feels too crowded. There's an indoor dining area where you can eat the things you've purchased. There's also a restaurant right in the middle of the store and a rice bakery \u2014 great for people who can't have gluten. I loved that there's a section just for items from Jeju.\n\nYou'll be able to find at least two options for most packaged foods. They also sell beauty products, kitchen equipment, prepared foods, frozen and marinated meat in a lot of cuts, seafood, and fresh produce.\n\nIn general, the prices are a little bit higher here than at H-Mart or Kukje. However, the bibimbap for $12 is a very competitive price, as well as kimbap for $6. They sell various kinds of bugak made in-store for $6 per bag, which is really high, but they also have mass-produced kim bugak for only $2 per bag \u2014 cheaper than anywhere else. It's between $2.50 to $7 per sheet mask, which is likely the most popular beauty product here. I drink Osulloc teas so I know they're much cheaper on Amazon.

Waffles were made fresh and as you see they give you butter and enough syrup for it. Waffles were buttery and flavorful. The wings were a perfect match. Chris\u2019s salty and sweet wings had me wanting more. Make sure to call or order online first or you will most likely be waiting in line to order.",
          "I've walked past this neighborhood place dozens of times. There's always somebody waiting for their order at the window. It was time I tried it. No place to sit down, just pick up your order and go.  About a 10 minute wait hanging out on the corner. I ordered the panko fried Chicken Sandwich with cucumber wasabi sauce. Very good. Next time I'll order a sauce with a little more spice.",

            "text": "We ordered KBBQ catering from Kiss My Seoul for our baby shower. Everything was absolutely delicious and our guests could not stop raving about the food. My husband picked up the order and said our car has never smelled better than when he was driving back with the food (even better than the smell of pizza)!\n\nWe got large trays of food and I was so excited to eat everything that I forgot to take a photo of my plate. We ordered the mando vegetarian dumplings, japchae (vegan), rice, tofu (vegan), chicken, pork and bulgogi beef along with steamed mixed vegetables. They also threw in two free bottles of kimchi aioli and a spicy red sauce which was very appreciated and unexpected!\n\nI worked directly with the owner Alex on all the details for the catering order - he was super professional, very responsive to all my questions, and quick to update the invoice estimates. He also gave me some great advice about portion sizing, especially assuming everyone would go down the line and try all of the dishes.\n\nI personally LOVED the mando and the japchae and I was pleasantly surprised to see purple rice (instead of plain white rice)! I had never seen dumplings that circular shape before, very interesting to see how consistent they were in shape/size and they were a big hit with the kids. We actually ended up running out of tofu because it looked so good that non-vegetarians also wanted to eat it! My vegan friend said that the tofu was well seasoned and packed full of flavor.\n\nOverall, I was thrilled with the taste and quality of the food - we took a bit of a gamble ordering from Kiss My Seoul to feed our closest family and friends since we had never eaten at the restaurant before. Can't wait to go back and check out the kimcheese smashburger sometime!",

I don't think I've ever left a review for a restaurant before, but I felt compelled after the incredibly attentive and respectful staff served us what is arguably the most deliciously balanced and  well portioned Italian meal we've ever had, at a compelling price point. The focaccia was beautifully baked, with interesting and delicate flavors that gave us an idea of what we had gotten ourselves into. Followed shortly thereafter by absolutely delectable duck liver pate and apricot crostinis. But the stars of the show were definitely the squid ink pasta and the raviolini. They were both superb: light but complex, savory but not too rich, and just enough on the plate to sate your hunger.

          "This chef is really imaginative with flavors and textures. A plateful of summer was found in the mozzarella with flamed peaches, cherries, pecans and arugula. The fresh focaccia had great herb flavor. The gem salad with clementines, avocado, and radishes and topped with hazelnut was a really lovely combination. The special was truffle tortellini with the Croatian truffle shaved right at the table and had incredible buttery richness. The budino chocolate dessert was immensely rich and smooth. What a great evening out and such lovely efficient service and beautiful ambience.",
          "Impressed, simply impressed. My fiance and I were astonished at the experience we had last night. I don't think I've ever left a review for a restaurant before, but I felt compelled after the incredibly attentive and respectful staff served us what is arguably the most deliciously balanced and  well portioned Italian meal we've ever had, at a compelling price point. The focaccia was beautifully baked, with interesting and delicate flavors that gave us an idea of what we had gotten ourselves into. Followed shortly thereafter by absolutely delectable duck liver pate and apricot crostinis. But the stars of the show were definitely the squid ink pasta and the raviolini. They were both superb: light but complex, savory but not too rich, and just enough on the plate to sate your hunger. Bravo!\nIf you're reading this review and you're debating dinner spots, your choice has been made for you -- choose Seven Hills."

          "La Ciccia is one of our favorite restaurants in SF. We\u2019ve been coming here a bunch over the past year and took our parents here whenever they are in town\n\nIt's a small family style restaurant with a cozy vibe, and the service is always friendly\n\nWe've tried pretty much everything on the menu at this point, and our favorite dishes are the roasted calamari, baby octopus stew, and oven roasted prawns. Everything is packed with flavor. This place is perfect if you like a little bit of spice in your dishes",
          "For the appetizer, we ordered Inzalaredda de Acciugasa e Arangiu, which paired perfectly with the bread. We also ordered Prupisceddu in Umidu cun Tomatiga, which was incredibly tender. Pasta Cruzza cun Arrizonis for the main course was very authentic, and eating it warm was a delightful experience. Pezza de Angioni a sa Saba was also very tender. The restaurant had a great ambiance, and the service was excellent!!!! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Quaint bistro in San Francisco Mission area with southern Italian cuisine focus. Food is fresh and there are daily specials to choose from. Reservations are highly recommended as the venue is small and often full and thus you run risk of not finding table if you they are full."

From the very beginning, she was noticeably unfriendly \u2014 she interrupted me while I was placing my order and kept rushing me, even though there was only one couple behind us who were still deciding what to get. It felt like she was deliberately speaking fast and harshly just to make it clear we weren\u2019t welcome. It was unpleasant and unnecessary.\nLater, she was the one who brought our food. She acted like she didn\u2019t see us and just slammed the plates down on the table. That kind of attitude is unacceptable. I also noticed in the comments that many other people have complained about this same blonde woman \u2014 so it\u2019s clearly not a one-time issue. It\u2019s a shame, because the food was genuinely delicious, and the dark-haired guy and girl were really friendly and kind. They created a nice atmosphere, and if it weren\u2019t for the rude behavior of the cashier, our overall impression would have been completely different.",

The food was excellent, although after a 4 course meal, I left that I was still hungry (portion sizes are extremely tiny). Service is over the top-waiters are very attentive and anticipate your every need throughout the meal. Atmosphere is nice but a bit pretentious with a restrictive dress code. What's absolutely outrageous is the price. A meal for 2 people with wine pairing (2oz pours x4) cost us $821!!\nIt is an offense to poverty-if I weren't gifted a $600 gift card, I would have never dined in such place.",

          "The restaurant is quite small and it was busy. At least last night, the best option was to eat at the bar.  From start to finish, everyone there were super friendly and efficient.\n\nWe started with a cup of clam chowder and 2 oyster shooters. The oysters were delicious and the chowder was full of clams. Yummy!\n\nAfter that, we ordered the sand dabs with spinach and steamed mussels. Wow!  Huge portions of delicious food. The sand dabs were sweet and flavored with lemon.  And the mussels while small were excellent too. We went through 2 bread servings to sop up the delicious broth.\n\nWe went early and there was a waiting line when we left.",
          "Good seafood at reasonable price.\n$2 oysters were fresh. Clams on half shell also nice.\nPortions are huge. Crab Louie is a mountain of lettuce with lots of fresh, crab meat. Clam chowder was solid but didn't stand out.\n\nOverall i enjoyed the meal.",
          "Great seafood restaurant\u2014definitely worth a visit. The food was excellent and the service was good.

Nestled in the heart of San Francisco, this Greek gem offers an authentic taste of Greece with a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. From the moment I stepped in, the staff greeted me warmly and provided excellent service throughout the meal.\n\nTo start, I tried the Grilled Octopus, which was tender and perfectly seasoned, providing a wonderful balance of flavors. For my main course, I opted for the Lamb Chops. They were cooked to perfection, with a juicy and succulent texture that melted in my mouth. Each bite was a testament to the restaurant\u2019s commitment to quality and authenticity.\n\nThe ambiance at Kokkari is cozy yet elegant, with a rustic decor that makes you feel right at home. The gentle lighting and meticulous attention to detail add to the dining experience, making it perfect for both intimate gatherings and larger celebrations.\n\nI finished my meal with a serving of Baklava, which was the perfect way to end the evening. The layers of pastry were crisp, and the sweetness was just right.\n\nOverall, Kokkari Estiatorio exceeded my expectations. With its outstanding cuisine, attentive service, and charming atmosphere, it\u2019s a place I would highly recommend to anyone looking to indulge in a memorable Greek dining experience.

Each small dish felt thoughtfully prepared from the creamy cheeses and honey to the vibrant olives and fresh fruits. The scrambled eggs with sausage (sucuk) were fluffy and perfectly seasoned, and the warm, fluffy pita slices were the perfect match. Their spinach and cheese b\u00f6rek was a real highlight too flaky, savory, and topped with a light sprinkle of sesame seeds.\n\nThe presentation alone is worth mentioning everything came out so colorful and inviting.

Even the dessert we tried, the kunafe was pretty one dimensional. Felt like it was just an overdose of sugar syrup and nothing else. The seating and management was also haphazard and chaotic. It was pretty much seat yourself wherever, order at the counter or via QR at table. However, this isn't clear on arrival and some patrons stand in line while others directly go seat themselves leading to different wait times and a scramble for seating during busy times. Prices are pretty reasonable which I felt is the only saving grace for us",

I must have walked by a dozen times and I feel like a complete fool for not giving them a shot sooner. The food is phenomenal. First off, the dolma was the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Seems simple, rice wrapped in grape leaves, right? But it was exceptional. The lamb kebab was delicious, the veggies were buttery and garlicky and perfectly cooked, the rice was flavorful, and that whole roasted tomato was like a nostalgia bomb that brought me back to my childhood. The restaurant itself is really nice too (they don\u2019t always have little skeleton farmers atop the bar but hey it\u2019s Halloween), and the staff is attentive and friendly.

The shrimp po\u2019 boy came on a soft brioche bun\u2014crispy shrimp, tangy sauce, and a nice balance of textures. The grilled oysters with garlic butter and Cajun spice were smoky and rich, with just the right kick.\n\nOur server\u2014whose name we didn\u2019t catch\u2014was friendly, quick, and clearly knew the place well.

The space is bright and open, with a great outdoor area and a high-seating bar that\u2019s actually a joy to sit at. Cold oysters are ultra-fresh, and the grilled ones are banging if that\u2019s your thing. Bonus points for the Bloody Mary\u2014easily one of the best I\u2019ve ever had.

          "Right near the ferry landing on the water side of San Francisco\u2019s Ferry Building, Hog Oyster Island Co. offers an easygoing spot to enjoy fresh seafood.\n\nThe rustic seafood stew was warm and flavorful, packed with a mix of seafood in a rich tomato broth, plus some good bread to soak it up. The shrimp po\u2019 boy came on a soft brioche bun\u2014crispy shrimp, tangy sauce, and a nice balance of textures. The grilled oysters with garlic butter and Cajun spice were smoky and rich, with just the right kick.\n\nOur server\u2014whose name we didn\u2019t catch\u2014was friendly, quick, and clearly knew the place well. He mentioned he\u2019s been with the restaurant for over 10 years, and it showed in how smoothly everything ran.\n\nSimple menu, great views, and a comfortable setting make it a solid stop if you\u2019re in the area.\n\nPro tip: parking near the Ferry Building can be tricky. Try downloading the SpotHero app to snag inexpensive parking nearby\u2014it saved us a lot of time and hassle. I paid $10.75 ! Yes, $10.75 for garage parking for 12 hrs but no in and out privileges.",
          "This is my favorite seafood spot\u2014everything is incredibly fresh. The only downside is the wait, which can be over an hour because it\u2019s so popular. It\u2019s perfect for a casual date or a fun night out with friends. Bring a bottle of wine and be sure to order the Dungeness crab! Both the chilled and roasted versions are amazing. And don\u2019t forget the grilled oysters\u2014you can\u2019t go wrong with either. This place is always my go-to when I\u2019m in San Francisco!",

          "Cash-only spot that is generous with high quality seafood at actually very good prices. Counter seating with all the fixings ready for you. Oysters are a must, and I\u2019d add the combination cocktail to the list as well. Everything else can be to your preference but I fancied the smoked salmon. Was easy to get seated as a solo diner.",
          "Nice atmosphere and good food. But when I wait one hour + and spend 100$ I expect something more elevated in quality and service. All together a nice experience but I would say its not worth the hype."

We ordered the 4 different subs, and they were all delicious - my favorite was the Molinari special. Prices were around $16 per sub, which is definitely big enough for one person. They cut it in half so you can exchange with your friend/family if you wanna try multiple subs.\n\nAs you walk in, you\u2019ll feel as if you were transported to Italy. The whole store is filled with imported food goods from Italy and it\u2019s a great vibe that gets your appetite going. They also slice the deli meat in front of you for some cool showmanship.\n\nMake sure to grab a ticket as soon as you walk in, as they\u2019ll call your number to take orders at the counter. The wait might be 20-30 mins depending on the day and time. If you are low on time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an essential spot to visit as I\u2019m sure there are other lesser known spots with just as good subs.",

          "Came here because of the great reviews and it did not disappoint. Sandwiches were great with tons of flavor and huge! I had lunch one day and breakfast the next :) the shop inside is also a great spot to buy different products. We came here on a Friday at 10:30 am so line was non existence although pictures suggest this become a hot spot at times. There are no seating area so one has to seat outside and can be chilling at times. Plus there is no bathroom. Overall a great spot and will highly recommend to visit and try their nice sandwiches",
          "They ran out of focaccia at 3pm\n\nTake a number and wait to be called. When they call your number, order, then pay when you pick up\n\nWas still good with soft bread, but not worth the 30min wait. Cheese was still cold after the sandwich was toasted",
          "It was crazy busy at 2pm yesterday. We waited 30 minutes to place our order. Was it worth it?  Not really. We ordered the Italian combo on Italian bread. That was a mistake. We like crusty bread but this was tough. Taking a bite required moving the bread back and forth to tear it off.\n\nThe flavor was great but it should be for $18. People behind the counter were friendly and there are a few tables outside."

The workers are definitely the kindest people and the environment is fun and relaxing. I am not sure why there is a one star review but I would give this more than 5 stars. If you ever come to San Francisco this is definitely a great meal. Thank you for a great experience!",

          "Literally the most delicious sandwich I\u2019ve eaten in my 34 years. We felt so welcome. It was the owner\u2019s birthday and after eating half of the HUGE sandwich she gifted us an amazing slice of chocolate mousse cake. We will absolutely be back! \u2665\ufe0f",
          "Had Hayes and corn salad. Couldn't get a picture of Hayes salad because someone wanted to dig in! We will rock you and I need a hero half sheet of lazy pizza! Had salads from there before and they're always fresh and have a nice balance of ingredients! The pizzas are nice, crunchy and soft! Best eaten soon after getting it. Service is excellent! Will be back to try other things on the menu!",
          "Amazing food, beyond amazing service, and quality meal!!! Ordered the chicken pesto avocado and had the mixed bliss salad. VERY GENEROUS PORTIONS! Everything tasted super fresh and delicious. The service was outstanding. Catalina was so nice and friendly and welcoming and made our experience wonderful! She was so kind and made sure we were really cared for and was super attentive (very rare in restaurants these days to have service as good as this). We really had a great time dining here and are going to come here again!!! The only problem is that there is limited seating if you are coming with a bigger party but other than that, 11/10 experience!!"

            "text": "Where Taste Meets Friendly Service\n\nA few days ago, I was walking by Le Sandwich, and I noticed them for the first time in the four years they've been in business! That should say something about my attention to my surroundings! I walked in to see what they offer. I ended up having a very friendly chat with the owner, Elias (Eli-S). He is a personable man and shared everything I needed to know, making me want to return and try one of his popular sandwiches. I say \"popular\" because while I was there, neighbor after neighbor walked in to place an order, and they all seemed to be repeat customers. Anyhow, I got myself a drip coffee and, as I walked out, made a mental note to be back after the Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nToday, I went back and asked Elias for his personal favorite sandwich. He obliged me, and I asked him which one it was when he handed me the hefty sandwich. He replied, \"You won't find it on the menu!\"\n\nI hurried home with the sandwich and took my first bite. It was delicious! The roasted chicken breast strips were cooked perfectly, juicy, and flavorful. The pesto sauce enhanced the taste, and the bread was toasted, thin, and hollowed out, holding everything together nicely! The sandwich had more than chicken and pesto sauce, but I was too hungry to slow down and analyze it!\n\nLe Sandwich has a couple of tables outside where, on a nice day, one can sit and enjoy their meal. They also have a few stools at a counter facing the window. You can get your sandwich to go, as I did, or eat it there before it gets cold!\n\nIn addition to sandwiches, Le Sandwich offers a variety of other items, including salads, and pastries. It also has a selection of beverages, from coffee and tea to fresh juices. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous. Le Sandwich is open from 9 AM to 3 PM every day except Sunday when it is closed.\n\nI highly recommend giving Le Sandwich a try. You won't be disappointed if you're in the mood for a quick bite or a leisurely meal.",

Well....That's a pretty tall statement, so I put on my kickin boots fired up the Ram and headed straight to SF.  I made the Golden Gate in an hour and was heading up Divisadero like I owned it, found a great parking spot, and only had to walk a half block to Q's\nIt was a typical unassuming neighborhood joint, a spot the locals would go to everytime they wanted real honest food.  I got that roast beef sandwich that Slingshot was so proud of and let me describe it in 2 words...\nWow and Amazing!  \u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606\u2606",

          "I\u2019m not from the area but I found this place on google. Seemed like a good place to have sandwiches. Man I am impressed these sandwiches are super amazing rich in taste. I got the turkey pesto guy recommended it. Super helpful and offer substitutions. Glad I came here !!",
          "Wow. Incredible sandwiches at a decent price. The menu had just enough options to make for some unique choices, but not so many as to take away from the quality. I\u2019m not even a sandwich person, but my roast beef on sourdough with bacon jam was to die for. Pickled onions are worth their weight in gold. Even my picky daughter finished her grilled ham and cheese.",
          "Ordered the turkey pesto sandwich on focaccia bread and substituted avocado for the bacon. It was so delicious! Bread was soft and the flavors were well balanced. All the ingredients were also very fresh. The store owner was incredibly friendly and very welcoming. Would definitely recommend and visit again."

I strolled in with high hopes and emerged victorious with a milkshake that\u2019s basically liquid gold: sea salt caramel as the silky base, crowned with two scoops of their olive oil ice cream. Olive oil in ice cream? It sounds like a madcap plot twist, but it delivers; creamy with a whisper of earthy savoriness that dances with the caramel like old flames rekindling. Each slurp was a symphony of rich, balanced bliss. I felt like I\u2019d unlocked a secret level in the game of desserts.\nBut wait, the drama unfolds: the straw. And hey, \u201cStraw\u201d is literally in their name... talk about irony! This biodegradable bad boy decided to split clean down the middle quicker than a celebrity couple in tabloid headlines. One moment it\u2019s heroically tackling the thick shake; the next, it\u2019s in two pieces, forcing me to improvise like a survivalist in the wilderness. Ended up tilting the cup back like I was toasting the gods. Pro tip: pack a backup straw forged from adamantium, or just lean into the mess.\nEven with the straw\u2019s split-second betrayal, this was an epic win. Salt & Straw, you\u2019re the flavor wizard I didn\u2019t know I needed. 5 stars, no notes, because who needs perfection when you\u2019ve got pure, chaotic joy? \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

            "text": "I consider this one of those establishments which is too hyped up and also \u2018tries too hard\u2019 so ends up being hit or miss. Many flavors, in fact, probably the majority of flavors, are unique and sound interesting but arguably sometimes just taste too weird or downright not yummy. Their limited traditional flavors like chocolate and vanilla are solid. I guess if one is an adventurous type and or bored of the usual flavors, this would be a great place, but those who prefer the standard and or tried and true flavor combos may not find their menu a bit over the top. Luckily, they do allow samples, otherwise it would be difficult and possibly disastrous to commit to an entire serving (which is of course pricey as expected for SF, without trying first.) interior was clean and nice, with 4 stools for seating (there are benches outside as well). Service was friendly and prompt.",

          "Oh man, where do I even start with Salt & Straw? This place is like if a rogue alchemist snuck into a dairy farm and started experimenting with forbidden elixirs. I strolled in with high hopes and emerged victorious with a milkshake that\u2019s basically liquid gold: sea salt caramel as the silky base, crowned with two scoops of their olive oil ice cream. Olive oil in ice cream? It sounds like a madcap plot twist, but it delivers; creamy with a whisper of earthy savoriness that dances with the caramel like old flames rekindling. Each slurp was a symphony of rich, balanced bliss. I felt like I\u2019d unlocked a secret level in the game of desserts.\nBut wait, the drama unfolds: the straw. And hey, \u201cStraw\u201d is literally in their name... talk about irony! This biodegradable bad boy decided to split clean down the middle quicker than a celebrity couple in tabloid headlines. One moment it\u2019s heroically tackling the thick shake; the next, it\u2019s in two pieces, forcing me to improvise like a survivalist in the wilderness. Ended up tilting the cup back like I was toasting the gods. Pro tip: pack a backup straw forged from adamantium, or just lean into the mess.\nEven with the straw\u2019s split-second betrayal, this was an epic win. Salt & Straw, you\u2019re the flavor wizard I didn\u2019t know I needed. 5 stars, no notes, because who needs perfection when you\u2019ve got pure, chaotic joy? \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

I also got the cheese foam matcha latte just to compare it with the ones I got from Izumi Matcha and Maruwu Seicha.

I think the owner should consider a price hike. I don't know if the older gentleman was the owner, but he was friendly and seemed to be an institution. I feel like there's probably some history here that's worth exploring the next time I'm back in the area. Looking for something other than an ice cream? There are plenty of other sweets as well. By the way, I'm not sure where the one hundred flavors tagline came from. Perhaps it's referencing all of the various items in the shop, not just the ice cream.",

Their basic flavors like cookies and cream and vanilla Have some uniqueness to it compared to what you would find elsewhere like Baskin-Robbins.\n\nCandy Cane had strong flavors of candy cane. Not overly sweet, and they were able to balance the sweetness and the peppermint in their ice cream. Very good!\n\nHoney lavender had a decently creamy texture. Had a strong floral scent, but not overpowering. Not too sweet. Very good!\n\nEggnog was absolutely the best I have ever tried! The employees told me that each scoop had roughly one teaspoon of brandy. The alcohol was strong, but overall a very strong balance of flavors.\n\nTheir ricanelas, triple chocolate coconut,  and pumpkin cheesecake were beautiful done. The texture of the triple chocolate was velvety and the taste of coconut was apparent. The ricanelas was pleasantly sweet, and not overpowering. All three of these flavors managed to balance, sweetness, and richness beautifully.\n\nThe rose ice cream was amazing. I tasted a lot of rose essence , but was not overpowering , nor was it too sweet. I really like the floral hint of the flavor.\n\nEarl Grey was pretty good, but I have had better. It could use just a slight bit of intensity, and then it will be perfect.\n\nThe candied spice and ginger ice cream was really good. All the flavors worked very well together. I like the bits of the ginger. It had a good texture, and was not overwhelming.\n\nOverall, they do not skimp on the ingredients, and they are not cheap with it. The quality of the vast majority of their flavors are apparent to the taste. Definitely the top three ice cream shops in San Francisco. I will definitely visit again.

          "Always a good time at Martuni\u2019s! Great martinis and a plethora of options. Live music on a piano with local singers galore! If you\u2019ve never been and you\u2019re a martini fan - you must! Great spot to take visitors too, always a fun experience.",
          "Fantastic atmosphere, piano was superb. It really suited my fancy. The lychee martini is a must drink. You must try it!"

We had a little trouble getting up there because the elevator we chose wouldn't let you go to the top floor, but we eventually made it by using a different elevator. It's quite a large space with almost every table having a view as there's a lower level with couches and tables for 2 facing the view and a slightly higher level with high top tables and chairs. We were told we could sit at any seat we wanted, so chose one facing the high rise buildings and Coit tower. The other side had a nice view of Golden Gate bridge but was partially closed off for a private party and got very bright just before sunset. I ordered Rising Sign and my friend ordered the cosmic cooler mocktail to start. My drink had a nice passion fruit flavor, but my friend thought hers was quite sour, we're guessing due to the blackberry and lime ingredients. For the second round, I ordered Baileyana Chardonnay and my friend ordered the Sunset Spritz. Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of the Chardonnay but my friend much preferred our mocktail this time. Would love to go back for sunset or to see the view at night.",

The vibe, the cocktails, the music \u2014 it used to strike a great balance. But after a recent visit, it feels like something\u2019s changed, possibly new management?\n\nThe music was so loud it made it hard to hold a conversation \u2014 which is surprising for a place known for its chill, sit-down cocktail experience. We ended up cutting the night short after one drink.\n\nAlso, the cocktails are now $18, which would be fine if the portion hadn\u2019t been noticeably smaller. It\u2019s hard to justify the value, especially when this place used to offer both quality and consistency.\n\nLastly, the new furniture looks fresh but is genuinely uncomfortable \u2014 especially the chairs with wheels and bouncy springs. Not great for a lounge-style setting.\n\nI\u2019m sharing this not to complain, but because this place has been a staple in SF and I\u2019d love to see it stay that way. The foundation is still there \u2014 it just needs a course correction before regulars like me stop coming back.",

My sister in law absolutely LOVED the Low Country Gumbo, my husband loved the meatloaf and cheesy grits, and I really loved the Our Burger, the fried chicken which was well seasoned and crispy to perfection!!!\n\nAs one would hope, the sides had us full of lots of ummms and aaaaaaas - and you would be remiss if you visit and don\u2019t try the mac and cheese & collard greens!\n\nAll of their team were super friendly, and answered all our questions.

It looked promising, but the flavor didn\u2019t quite show up to the party. Just kinda... there.\n\nMac & Cheese: I really wanted to love it, but it just didn\u2019t deliver. Ended up leaving most of it behind.\n\nFried Okra: Now this was the MVP of the night. Perfect crunch, great seasoning, full of flavor. If you go, don\u2019t skip it.\n\nFried Chicken: Solid. Really solid. Not a mind-blowing 5-star moment, but a strong 4+\u2014well-seasoned, juicy, and served hot.\n\nRum Punch: Hard pass. Didn\u2019t enjoy it at all\u2014wouldn\u2019t be mad if they quietly took it off the menu.\n\nService: A+\nThe staff was wonderful\u2014warm, welcoming, and helpful. Honestly, they made the experience feel a lot better.\n\nAtmosphere? Eh...\nI wanted to vibe with it, but it just didn\u2019t click. Maybe it was an off night, but the energy felt kind of flat for a Friday evening.\n\nFinal take:\nThere are definitely some gems on the menu (hello, fried okra!), and the service is top-notch, but it wasn\u2019t a slam dunk overall. Worth checking out\u2014just go in with balanced expectations and maybe skip the rum punch.\n\n3.5/5",

          "All of the stars aligned when our group of 9 were able to grab dinner at Brenda\u2019s (despite not having a reservation)!! We initially resigned on having to do takeaway - but magically all the seating at the bar opened up (this was also within the last hour of opening)!!\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious, generously portioned, and clearly made with a lot of love and care. My sister in law absolutely LOVED the Low Country Gumbo, my husband loved the meatloaf and cheesy grits, and I really loved the Our Burger, the fried chicken which was well seasoned and crispy to perfection!!!\n\nAs one would hope, the sides had us full of lots of ummms and aaaaaaas - and you would be remiss if you visit and don\u2019t try the mac and cheese & collard greens!\n\nAll of their team were super friendly, and answered all our questions. The restaurant has a super cozy and trendy vibe, and I would say this is a must-visit for anyone craving authentic soul food done right!!",
          "Immediately when I walked in, I felt a warm welcome. I came solo so I sat at the dining counter which is the best seat ion the house. Everyone worked well together and my food and drinks were prepared quickly. I had the fried catfish, green salad, fries, and red beans & rice and I cleaned my plate. I also indulged in a wild berry and mango mimosa and let me just say I love their proportions for the price. Will definitely be coming back to eat more items from their menu.",

As I arrived, the small tables for two people were filling up very quickly. Luckily I got seated right away. After 6PM, you need to wait in line, so I highly suggest to come here 5 to 6 PM. Yes it is early for dinner unless you don't mind to wait. To me, I hate waiting. Lol. I ordered B2 which was Premium Kalbijjim with regular size. This portion definitely can fill up more than 2 people. I also added extra rice cake and cheese. Both add-ons were 11 bucks. The cheese itself seemed  to be worth it, but not for the extra rice cake. I counted the total and it was like 10 pcs, so basically a handful.  The short rib was well tender and cooked. The services were on point and efficient. As soon as we were done, we paid and left because I didn't want others to wait too long. I suggest you do the same and don't sit and chat after you finished eating. It's a common courtesy. I also recommend to park at the Jtown plaza because street parking spaces are limited due to high volume of cars. I definitely come back to try other food on the menu like Seolleong Tang and Mandu Guk. Big fan. Keep up the good work!",

However, the combination of the sweet sauce with minimal acidity and how fatty galbi can get I found these to be quite heavy. I would have preferred more acidity in the marinade.\n\nSsam: Nothing special but nice to have leaves with kbbq. Criminal pricing though.\n\nGrilled Tteok: sickly sweet and sticky. Didn't really enjoy.\n\nI loved their home made sauces to have with the meat. Overall, I would return to San Ho Won but their prices are on the higher end. In other cities you can probably get something 80% as good for 40% of the price."

Laid-back vibes, incredible food, and dog-friendly to boot.\n\nCame here during a work trip and once again Tempest Bar & Box Kitchen proved why it\u2019s one of my favorite SF spots. I visited last year to catch a Stanley Cup Final game and made a point to come back this year. It didn\u2019t disappoint.\n\nThe setup is unique and works perfectly: food is ordered from Box Kitchen just outside the bar, but it\u2019s all part of the same experience. I showed up on a Thursday night and had no trouble grabbing a table, then snagged two seats at the bar after about a 45-minute wait (worth it). Super dog-friendly. My buddy brought his pup, and there were at least two others hanging out. Dogs, beer, and hockey? Yes please.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and cool, with music playing and plenty of regulars chatting up the bartenders. You can tell it\u2019s a neighborhood joint. Friendly staff, people actually talk to each other, and the bartenders were cracking jokes and making everyone feel welcome.\n\nNow the food? Ridiculous. I don\u2019t usually wax poetic about tomato soup, but theirs deserves a TED Talk. I had it last year and literally came back for it. Big portion, perfectly toasted bread on the side, and chunks of cheese floating in that rich tomato goodness. It\u2019s comfort food that punches above its weight. Also, get the mac & cheese eggrolls. You won\u2019t regret it. The whole Box Kitchen crew was friendly and made ordering a breeze.\n\nIf you want a local spot with personality, legit food, and a come-as-you-are vibe, this place is it. Already looking forward to next year\u2019s trip so I can go back again.",

They do seat a few people at the bar. But if it\u2019s your first time, Highly recommend reservations for the full experience.\n\nWe needed the full 90 minutes and enjoyed every minute of it. Between 2 people, we ordered shishito peppers, 2 Nigiri and 3 specialty rolls. I think 2 nigiri and 2 specialty rolls would have been the perfect amount!\n\nHighly highly highly recommend the boddy and soul. Probably one of the best on the menu!

It's located inside the Japan center mall, so there is plenty of shopping, drinks, food and some claw machines while you wait. Our server was amazing. She explained everything to us that we had questions about, I have a food allergy, and she tripled checked if what I ordered had my allergy. Unfortunately, it did, but she was able to recommend something quick. We had a great time, and the kids loved it.",

            "text": "We visited the Marufuku Ramen location in San Francisco, inside the Japan Center (Kinokuniya Building), and it did not disappoint. We got there pretty close to closing time, but the staff was super friendly and didn\u2019t rush us at all.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen was absolutely incredible\u2014just like what I had at their Oakland location. The broth was rich, creamy, and full of flavor. A lot of places mess this up and serve something too thin or watered down, but Marufuku nails it. The chashu was perfectly cooked, tender, and packed with flavor. Portions were generous too, which is always a plus.\n\nWe also tried the takoyaki and the shrimp buns, and both were awesome. The takoyaki had that perfect soft-inside, crispy-outside texture, and the shrimp buns were flavorful and satisfying. The karaage was decent, though it felt more like regular fried chicken than classic Japanese-style karaage.\n\nThe space is upstairs in the Kinokuniya building, with a casual vibe and a solid drink menu as well.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing spot for ramen and small bites in the city. Whether you\u2019ve been to their other locations or not, this one\u2019s absolutely worth checking out. Highly recommend!",

          "It\u2019s definitely worth the wait! We got the regular pork belly Ramen: the broth, the veggie, the condiment, the noodles, the egg everything is like a Symphony harmonically dancing together. Just fight through your hunger and impatience while being in line but the end is all worth it! It currently kids, friendly restaurant, providing kids water cups kids utensils. The service is very fast.",
          "Great broth, full of flavor. Tried their Hakata Tonkotsu Dx, the egg was perfect, the meat very tender and the corn definitely sweet and delicious! This location is always packed and there's usually a long wait at peak hours. It's a cute place, especially if you sit by the windows in the back of the restaurant, but it felt a bit cramped. The tables are so close that it almost feels like you are sitting at a bar counter. Which, of course, makes quite a bit uncomfortable if you're looking to have a somewhat private conversation over a meal. At least if you are at a counter you can whisper, not the case here. The service was polite, helpful. Overall a great ramen place!",

Mensho is a chain of ramen bars from Japan.\n\nIt was 10:30pm on a Thursday night, a full 45-minutes prior to closing. I thought for sure there'd be no line. Surprise, surprise, we were greeted with a short line about 10 deep. Haters passed by, obnoxiously saying \"OMG, it's noodles and water!?\" And \"This was the worst place I've ever eaten at!\" Well, you know what? You don't know JACK, f'n top ramen haters!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe tiny shop sports 3 communal high tops and a low-seat counter for a grand total of about 30 warm bodies. You will wait and you will sit with, amongst, or even in between strangers. While hangrily waiting outside, I was getting annoyed at the patrons inside who were SLOWLY eating their ramen, thinking they were doing it deliberately. Explanation will be revealed below.\n\nMENU:\nRamen, mazesoba & aburasoba (soup-less ramen), rice, beer, sake. I didn't see tsukemen listed.\n\nFOOD:\nTori Paitan\nI've heard of this broth style and was anxious to try it. I added a shoyu ajitama. It's been a while since a bowl of ramen made me moan. Wow to the rich, thick, creamy and searing hot broth. I was expecting it to be white in color but it was tannish/light brown. The noodles were wavy and thick, cooked springy al dente and served piping hot too, YES! Included toppings were kale (which I could do without due to its tough stalk), bamboo, dried burdock shavings, green onion, pork chashu and something I've never had, duck chash that was amazing. Nearing the end of the bowl, you're so full from the broth's richness and thickness, you will slow down. Sorry for talking crap about those inside before me who I thought were table camping, lol. Highly recommended for the ramen connoisseur.\n\nEnoki Mushroom Chips\nYum, like mushroom tempura! The squeeze of lemon and sprinkling of a red spicy-looking salt really weren't needed.\n\nOrganic Shoyu Ramen\nI'm a shoyu broth fanatic so this was a must-try. The broth had a strong smoky-bonito flavor which I loved. Unfortunately they ran out of both miso & shoyu ajitamas 2 hours after opening, but I did get added bean sprouts and the included pork and duck chashu, bamboo, nori square and yucky kale, though the kale sprouts were good. The noodles in this version were flat and wide, still cooked perfectly chewy and came out searing hot. This ranks right up there for me with the version at Momofuku.\n\nSpicy Lamb Ramen\nIf you think the Tori Paitan is thick and rich, this sucker is beats it. It's a miso broth topped with ground lamb, pork chashu, nira (Chinese leeks) bamboo and green onions. No egg for my spouse either as they ran out, but he did receive burdock shavings. The spoonful of broth I tasted was intense and a bit like curry. Personally, I'd stick to the paitan for a rich broth, but he absolutely loved it.\n\nSERVICE:\nNo reservations are made. We were seated in about 35 minutes. The staff were friendly and professional, and food service was quick. The only hiccup was the absence of a requested glass of water.\n\nTIPS:\nThe menu posted at the sidewalk entry is less detailed than the menu given at the table (some ramen styles and toppings weren't listed).\n\nThere's an automatic 15% gratuity to all parties, something I despise. What a shame because I would've left 20%.\n\nOVERALL:\nWas it worth the wait? Absolutely.",
