We ordered the adeni chai and the bee bite. Both were delicious! The chai was well flavored and very strong. We liked it with no sugar. However towards the end, we got some chunks of tea leaves so we had to waste the last few sips. We got the seeds and sesame bee bite served warm with the honey on the side. It had such a nice lightly crispy top with a soft bread pull between each hive bite.",

This was exactly what I was looking for, great coffee/espresso, service, and a focus on the craft. I tried to sample as much as the menu as possible. The cortado stood out as one of the best I've ever had and the coffee flight really allowed me to compare the differences between their selection of beans. It was a delight to pair the flight with my pastry. The lighter roast went well and the rounding it out after finishing with the more medium one.\n\nThis is definitely a spot I'll seek out every visit to SF.",

            "text": "I visited Haraz Coffee two days ago and had a really pleasant experience. I ordered the Haraz Latte, which was smooth, aromatic, and had just the right balance of flavor. The caf\u00e9 had a warm, welcoming atmosphere, perfect for relaxing or catching up with friends.\n\nWhat stood out most was the service especially from Sarah. She was incredibly friendly, attentive, and made the visit even more enjoyable. Not to mention, she\u2019s beautiful, which added a lovely charm to the experience.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d definitely recommend Haraz Coffee for both its drinks and its vibe. I\u2019m already looking forward to my next visit.",

I wanted to love their take on the Dubai chocolate cake, but unfortunately since it sits in close proximity and in the same case as the items made with rose water, it's ruins the cake because it picks up the rose essence and you taste it \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude2b\n\nThe best item, im my opinion, is their baklava cheesecake. Its the star \ud83d\ude3b just get it, no doubt that you'll be happy you did.\n\nSkip the beautiful pistachio croissant.",
          "Staff are friendly.  Love the ambience. Perfect for socializing, relaxing, maybe working. We definitely enjoyed their Matcha Latte & Pistachio Latte. Their Mosaic Dubai was so delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness & very smooth.",
          "At first I just wanted to get my fave crispy sweets walking from brunch at @DACHA, but the cozy place and the Chai on the menu sound promising. I ended up getting rose milk cake too but that's a bit disappointing not so much rose taste. But the drinks and the ambience are just perfect!"

Seriously. Pour-overs that make you reconsider your life choices, most of the time. The fit-out is clean, modern, and quietly confident, just like the espresso. If you\u2019re here for conversation or small-town hospitality, you might be disappointed. But if you\u2019re here to caffeinate and get on with your day, you\u2019ve found your place.\n\nPrice point is solid. I usually pop in for a split shot to share with my partner and finish with a pour over. I pay for the single estate coffee, because why would you not.\n\nLet\u2019s be real: the service doesn\u2019t quite hit warm-and-fuzzy, but then again, you don\u2019t go to a tattoo artist for a cuddle, and you don\u2019t come here for chit-chat. You come for seriously well-made coffee, and in that department, they overdeliver. Whether you\u2019re grabbing a quick takeaway or lingering to people-watch in the Richmond flow, Coffee Movement delivers on its promise, maybe not the \u201cgood times,\u201d but definitely the \u201cbetter coffee.\u201d\n\nMost chumps order milky coffees... perhaps the baristas want to serve people that love coffee.

I encourage avoiding the pastries if you have a peanut/tree nut allergy. They did look good though so if you don\u2019t have an allergy go ham.",
          "I really enjoy coming here. The coffee is amazing, the staff is friendly, and the pastries are fresh. You can work comfortably and there is a lot of space. There is also a nice outdoor space. The pastries can run out over the weekend so come early."

It was melt cheese, ground beef, ketchup, lettuce, pickle and tomato and was so good. The crust was thick but light and fluffy. I really liked it.\n\nI tried the pepperoni too and enjoyed it, but not as much as the Detroit style.\n\nThe service was friendly though they never refilled our waters.\n\nI\u2019d definitely come back.

It\u2019s the kind of comfort food that hits the spot; rich in flavor and clearly made with love and good ingredients.\nBoth items were freshly made to order and served hot. We could immediately tell the difference that quality ingredients make \u2013 nothing tasted processed or bland.

It\u2019s not a triangle. It\u2019s like a block so I don\u2019t consider it a slice. At first sight, I thought maybe it\u2019s going to be a little too doughy? After one bite, the flavors of the topping and the crunch of the crust were so satisfying. The shaved cheese gave it a nice finish. Will need to come back to try other pizzas next time.",
          "Did someone say PECKING DUCK pizza!? No this is not a joke \ud83e\udd86\ud83c\udf55\n\n@thatsouttasight has brought this unique twist and it\u2019s honestly so good! They also have other amazing combos and authentic New York style pizzas right here in San Francisco. Service was nice and it\u2019s a small quick grab and go place. As most places in the city haha there\u2019s a parking garage about 2 blocks down thankfully!"

The issues I had was these; Extremely long wait times to be seated, for me it was 1.5 hrs so plan ahead.  Second the service was OK, but hard to get their attention and too many different people serving our table.  I ask three different people who came to my table for the check.  I had to find our waiter. Third,  the seating is outside on the curb. It can be nice but on a chilly SF evening it isn't.\nOverall I really liked to food.",

          "We usually get the burgers and do highly recommend them as they are delicious and very satisfying.\nThis time we each tried something different for takeout: my husband got the OG zapato and like that very much. I got the spicy fried chicken sandwich, which to me did not register as spicy enough.. plus the BBQ sauce with it was just too much sweetness which I would also not prefer for a \"spicy fried chicken sandwich\". Others may like this if they can only tolerate a little amount of heat, which is balanced by sweet- it's just not for me.",
          "This place has been here forever and you can tell why. It's still super reasonably priced and the food is great. They always have tasty and unique stuff on tap too. My go-to is the Surfer Leo, but every burrito I've had has been good, as are the nachos.",
          "Great vibes but pretty pricey food. Fish tacos were solid and yummy but expensive."

Went to Beep's last night around 11pm (love that they're open until 2am - perfect for late night cravings) and ordered their 1/2 pound burger well done with American cheese, avocado, and bacon plus fries. Holy cow, this might honestly be the best burger I've had in San Francisco. The patty was cooked perfectly - well done but still juicy somehow. The bacon was crispy, avocado was fresh, and everything just worked together so well. Even the fries were on point - crispy outside, fluffy inside. Yes, $25 for a burger and fries is pretty steep, but I'm not even mad about it because the quality was there. You can tell they use good ingredients and actually care about what they're putting out. The late hours are clutch too - there aren't many places doing quality food past midnight in the city. Staff was friendly even though it was late and they probably wanted to go home. If you're a burger lover, you need to check this place out. I'm already planning my next visit and trying to figure out what else on their menu is worth trying. Beep's just earned a loyal customer!\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",

While I was lucky enough to get one of the 6 spots in the lot, that was only after I circled the block 3 times. Street parking was also not an option without an unreasonable amount of walking.\n\nMy one compliment about the burger is how well the done the milliard is. It is in the style of a lacy edge smash patty and imparts flaky bits of crispy beef to each bite. Other than that, it\u2019s just an average hamburger.\n\nThe garlic fries were a major let down. They smelled phenomenal and were heavily seasoned  with garlic and green onion but ate like stale, greasy cardboard. They sat in my stomach and were miserable.\n\nMaybe I just caught Beep\u2019s Burgers on an off day but because of my experience, I will not be giving them a second chance.",

          "Finally found my new go-to burger spot in SF! Went to Beep's last night around 11pm (love that they're open until 2am - perfect for late night cravings) and ordered their 1/2 pound burger well done with American cheese, avocado, and bacon plus fries. Holy cow, this might honestly be the best burger I've had in San Francisco. The patty was cooked perfectly - well done but still juicy somehow. The bacon was crispy, avocado was fresh, and everything just worked together so well. Even the fries were on point - crispy outside, fluffy inside. Yes, $25 for a burger and fries is pretty steep, but I'm not even mad about it because the quality was there. You can tell they use good ingredients and actually care about what they're putting out. The late hours are clutch too - there aren't many places doing quality food past midnight in the city. Staff was friendly even though it was late and they probably wanted to go home. If you're a burger lover, you need to check this place out. I'm already planning my next visit and trying to figure out what else on their menu is worth trying. Beep's just earned a loyal customer!\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b",
          "Outstanding Smashburger with beautiful crusty American cheese. The bun is super fresh and the sauce is very complementary. The fries came out like lava, super hot and fresh. The nuggets are cooked to order and were steaming hot. I ordered a six piece and they gave me seven!",
          "Just moved into town, definitely not coming back here when I become a local though, found hair in my garlic fries!!  However, there were so good so it\u2019s a shame that this happened. I would say it would be a gamble to come here because the service was overall mediocre. But the food and history make up for it. Maybe next time they\u2019ll be no hair, and same good fries? Who knows, but I sure won\u2019t be finding out!"

Thank you to the wonderful lady who assisted us with our order as she helped a booming amount of customers and pushed out several to-go orders. She was smiling throughout and extremely courteous! The Springtime Burger is DELICIOUS. When I am back in SF, I will be sure to visit. I\u2019m glad the reviews I read lived up to the hype. 10/10 and worth your money. Take a visit \ud83d\udc93",
          "Roam is a solid and consistent spot for burgers, has the mom and pop creativity with the corporate consistency. I will always praise their zucchini fries, as they are literally addictive. Always delicious and cleanly presented. I do enjoy that they have their seasonal menus come and go, as you don\u2019t see that too often in burger joints. Counter service makes it nice and relaxed and for the whole family or a solo meal. As this is not a hidden gem, you know what youre gonna get here."

As vegans, finding great food can feel like an uphill battle, but Wildseed makes it effortless\u2014and incredibly enjoyable.\n\nThe moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted by Jarod, I believe the manager, who immediately made us feel welcome and accommodated. His enthusiasm and attentiveness set the tone for an incredible experience.\n\nOur server, Shadwa, was nothing short of amazing. From the start, she checked in on our preferences and any allergies we might have, ensuring every dish was tailored perfectly for us. Her friendliness and genuine care made our meal feel special\u2014and her warm smile never left her face throughout the entire experience. What truly impressed us, though, was when Shadwa requested a slight modification to one of our dishes on our behalf. It\u2019s clear that Wildseed\u2019s team is all about going above and beyond to make sure their guests feel celebrated and cared for.\n\nThe food? Simply put: fresh, vibrant, and full of flavor. Every bite felt like a celebration of plant-based cuisine, with dishes that were as visually stunning as they were delicious. The ambiance was equally impressive\u2014modern, clean, and inviting, with a lively energy that made us feel right at home.\n\nFrom start to finish, Wildseed exceeded our expectations in every way. The combination of outstanding service, nutritious and flavorful food, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere makes this place a top contender for the best vegan restaurants in SF. If you\u2019re in the area and (especially if you\u2019re vegan), Wildseed is a must-visit.\n\nThank you to Jarod and Shadwa for making our experience so memorable\u2014you truly shine, and we can\u2019t wait to return!",

          "Wildseed in San Francisco has quickly become a gem in the vegan dining scene, and for good reason! As vegans, finding great food can feel like an uphill battle, but Wildseed makes it effortless\u2014and incredibly enjoyable.\n\nThe moment we walked in, we were warmly greeted by Jarod, I believe the manager, who immediately made us feel welcome and accommodated. His enthusiasm and attentiveness set the tone for an incredible experience.\n\nOur server, Shadwa, was nothing short of amazing. From the start, she checked in on our preferences and any allergies we might have, ensuring every dish was tailored perfectly for us. Her friendliness and genuine care made our meal feel special\u2014and her warm smile never left her face throughout the entire experience. What truly impressed us, though, was when Shadwa requested a slight modification to one of our dishes on our behalf.

The Mac and cheese is fine but not spectacular.\n\nFor dessert, the chocolate peanut butter bar is excellent, but get the vanilla ice cream rather than the coffee cocoa nib vegan ice cream if you can.

Accompanying this was a sunomono salad\u2014crisp cucumber slices mingled with a hint of cinnamon, presenting a dance of flavors both refreshing and unexpected.

The Cha-Ya Roll, a signature creation, boasts tempura-fried vegetables enveloped in sushi rice, drizzled with a soy-ginger glaze\u2014a harmonious blend of texture and taste. The Kinoko Udon, with its medley of mushrooms in a savory broth, promises comfort on fog-laden evenings. For those seeking variety, the Cha-Ya Nabe presents a hearty hot pot brimming with tofu, vegetables, and delicate noodles, inviting communal indulgence.\n\nIn an age where the essence of Japanese cuisine is often overshadowed by the ubiquity of meat and fish, Cha-Ya stands as a beacon for those yearning for authenticity without compromise. It is a place where the principles of compassion and culinary excellence converge, offering nourishment that transcends the mere physical.\n\nAs I departed, the lingering flavors and the establishment\u2019s quiet dignity left an indelible impression.

I\u2019m vegan and appreciate how nearly every dish is already vegan and those that aren\u2019t mostly all can be adjusted.\n\nI\u2019ve been numerous times now and have never been disappointed.

I suggested to one of the cashiers to post a picture of their pasty options online, and they said \u201cyou can just take a picture\u201d. I just politely suggested it because as I told them, too, I didn\u2019t want to hold the line while deciding what to get. It was very rude of them to not take it and maybe just pretend they were open to feedback. So this is the only place for me to write a feedback on their customer service. I don\u2019t find myself as interested in their business as I used to be anymore and that\u2019s a shame. Fortunately, there are plenty of bakeries around here with new ones opening all the time."

They\u2019re known for the almond croissant and I definitely understand why: crispy outside and soft on the inside rich with almond paste that tastes natural and not artificial. I think it is a bit on the sweeter side though. The ham and cheese croissant was my favorite because we got it warm and the cheese pull was crazy. The ham in the croissant was also super meaty and didn\u2019t taste like soft thin deli meat. Also tried the kouignn amann which wasn\u2019t as remarkable as the other two. It was like a rolled up less crunchy version of a croissant with sugar glaze.",

We also had the prosciutto & burrata sandwich, which was amazing. The salad sandwich was packed with fresh ingredients, but the bread was a bit soggy and too soft, which took away from the overall experience. There was a long line and unfortunately no seating available, so we ended up eating in the park across the street. It would have been lovely to enjoy our coffee in ceramic cups instead of paper, if only there had been a place to sit. Still, everything tasted great and the quality was high.",

Freshly made in their original store one block over since the 1970s!\nNow there\u2019s an additional new Bob\u2019s Donuts location at 1720 Polk (the next block North)!\nThe Grand Opening was SO Fun!\nPeople lined up before the doors opened at 10 am on 2/21/25. As we patrons got to the doorway, we were treated to a Freshly fried Glazed Donut.\nThe inside was completely new.\nThe counter had the variety of donuts all laid out. It was a rainbow of colored frosting. Donuts of all sizes.\nI bought a strawberry malasada, which was like a strawberry compote sugar donut. Delicious! So light & airy inside!\nPast the cashier, Bob\u2019s Donuts family members handed out complimentary tote bags and a long-stem rose! \ud83c\udf39\nThere\u2019s nothing better than nostalgia, neighborhood bakeries, supporting a local Nob Hill family business & fresh donuts!",

This was actually the most disappointing - too sweet and crumbly texture. The other donuts were average quality, nothing better than what you'd find at other local shops.\nHard to understand why this place has such long lines and recognition. There are better donut options in the city without the wait and hype.\nI do think Bob's Donut doesn't live up to the legend.",

The drinks were very interesting, and the taste was impressive. The chicken and waffles, while not spicy or over seasoned were very good. And crispy outside and juicy inside.

            "text": "Pleasant restaurant with their fried chicken being my favorite. The waffles were soft for my liking. I prefer crisp to my waffle. The dunginess crab benedict plate was solid. The potato combination and salad were great compliments to the benedict. The benedict itself was better with the potatoes too add savoriness to the meal. The matcha latte topped with whipped cream and an matcha ice formed bear, salted caramel Irish cream, and espresso macchiato were all recommendable. The service is okay. If I were to recommend a must try, it would be a plate to your liking with fried chicken. The selling point is the amazing fried chicken.",

          "Visited Lapisara on Saturday for brunch. Despite the line outside, we were seated quickly.\nTried the Crab Omelette and Chili Bomb Basil Omelette - both excellent! Really interesting take on breakfast with authentic Thai flavors. Much more exciting than typical American brunch options.\nThe Ube Latte was beautifully presented in a very cute cup, but unfortunately too sweet for our liking.\nService was attentive and professional throughout our meal.\nRecommended for anyone looking to try something different for brunch. The Thai-style omelettes are definitely worth the visit.",
          "While we were in the city, we decided to stop by Lapisara Eatery for a nice brunch and it ended up being one of the highlights of our trip. This cozy little corner spot has a chill vibe, street views, and a solid brunch menu. The food came out quick, looked amazing, and tasted just as good. I had the best Belgian waffles I\u2019ve ever had crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy inside. They also had a great selection of lattes and a decent drink menu, which made the whole experience even better. Everything tasted fresh, the service was smooth, and the atmosphere was calm and relaxing. If you're visiting San Francisco and want a brunch spot that really hits the mark, this is one you definitely need to check out.",

          "The food and atmosphere was amazing here! Try their SMSF pancakes,which are thin and soft with maple syrup, we added the berries topping with extra 5 dollars, it was worth it!!\nWell roasted coffee with sweet pancakes were perfect match!\nIt\u2019s my second time visiting SF, can\u2019t believe I found such a cute brunch cafe.\nI kept asking for my coffee to be refilled, and we\u2019ve waited for the server to ask for the check,however I understood it was a busy restaurant\nThe only thing surprised and confused, they take 6%of your purchase for employees benefits fee \ud83d\ude4f",
          "Incredible. What an awesome breakfast place! Ordered, pancake, French toast, eggs, potatoes and the famous bacon. Everything was good, nothing was disappointing. You have to try the bacon at the very least because, wow, that taste! We came around 9:30 on a Sunday, huge line but the wait isn\u2019t long. For some reason they weren\u2019t checking if people wanted to eat outside? We would have opted for it and I even let the front host know and he never sat us, the whole time there were open seats! Even though that was annoying we still ate.\n\nWorth a visit.",
          "A friend and I walked to Sweet Maple as the sun broke through the summer fog this morning. I can imagine that on a weekend morning, Sweet Maple has a long queue of people waiting, but on this Thursday morning around 9:00am we were seated immediately.  We shared a Millionaire Bacon platter (pictured) and all I can say is, if you love bacon, you will be completely delighted as you eat this bacon like a millionaire. My Marnier French Toast was delicious and flavorful. My friend had eggs prepared to perfection. The wait staff was responsive, plentiful and excellent. The environment was clean, modern and well lit."

I was seated right away, and my server was super friendly and attentive without being over the top.\n\nThey started me off with a warm slice of coffee cake and some really creamy butter. Simple but so good. I went with a seafood-focused brunch and kicked things off with the dry aged amberjack melon crudo. It was incredibly refreshing, with the perfect mix of sweet melon, citrus, and delicate fish.\n\nThe highlight was the butter poached lobster eggs Benedict. The lobster was tender and full of flavor, and the eggs and hollandaise were cooked perfectly. Even the greens on the side were fresh and bright.\n\nTo finish, I had the beignets. They were warm, light, and fluffy, served with a rich chocolate sauce and smooth cr\u00e8me anglaise. The chocolate sauce was especially good.\n\nOverall, Spruce absolutely delivered. The food, service, and vibe all came together for a really memorable brunch. If you are looking for a refined but relaxed spot in San Francisco, I definitely recommend it. I will be back.",

          "The service was phenomenal, but our entrees were quite frankly inedible. I really wish I had said something, but we were celebrating a birthday, so I didn\u2019t want to tarnish the evening. The attached photo was of my entree, it\u2019s poached salmon. There was absolutely no seasoning, my friends and I were fighting over the salt that came with the table butter. Our bill was over $900 for four people. I really wish we had a better experience considering how much we were looking forward to this meal and how much we had spent.",
          "The staff are always the cornerstone of any notable restaurant experience, and Spruce\u2019s team genuinely delivered. Our server, Michael, was so kind, and his attentiveness really made our night.\n\nEvery dish was beautifully and creatively presented, but our favorites were the Yukon potatoes and the Wagyu New York Strip.\n\nAs someone with celiac disease, I felt incredibly well cared for. The staff was knowledgeable, which helped with restaurant anxiety regarding gluten. Really thoughtful modifications were made to ensure our meals were both entirely gluten-free, which did not compromise the flavor! That especially can be hard to find in a restaurant. :)\n\nReally really enjoyed once again, could not recommend more.\n\nConcerning the first picture, I did dim the light a bit! It\u2019s not that dark in person, but it is a dimmer & more intimate setting.",
          "Very nice restaurant with top class service and elegant atmosphere. The food was the best part: everything was perfectly cooked and presented . Would love to come back and have the black truffle pasta again! The giant cookie was also delicious \ud83e\udd24"

Make sure you reserve your table via the website before showing up, to ensure you don't wait very long.\n\nThis was among the best meals I have ever had. My meal was the Shrimp Pot Pie, which was a daily special. (Not on the menu. Just on the chalk board.) Amazing!\n\nMy friend got the Hangtown fry with cheese grits and a biscuit with homemade strawberry preserves.  She said the biscuit was the best she'd ever had, and she's from Florida! I had never seen bacon and oyster cooked together with eggs. My friend sang it's praises.\n\nOh, and we started with the beignets! They were enormous.  They come in an order of 3 which is too much for 2 people about to eat a huge meal. I'd recommend asking for 2 instead of you are only 2 people. These were excellent beignets.\n\nOur waitsraff were \"Johnny-on-the-spot\" with the water refills. So kind and helpful too.\n\nWe will be back.\n\nWord of advice- get there betweem 8am and 10am or definitely you'll want a reservation. Leave time for parking too, btw.",

Perfect texture and flavors from all menu items. Tomorrow we will be trying all of their famous beignets.My favorite was the beignets. They were so soft and crunchy and the seasoning was amazing.",
          "Wow, our server was so helpful and kind. The food spoke for itself. Absolutely delicious. We went on a Sunday morning in June. The vibe was chill lots of small groups and couples coming in and out. We tried several things on the menu. Great flavors in everything. \ud83d\udcaf Recommend.",

It was my first time here and it defintetly not be my last!\n\nFrom the moment you walk in and get greeted by the staff and sushi chefs, to the servers meticuosly clearing dishes and plates, you feel very welcomed.\n\nThe food was so well prepared, fresh, and simply delicious. It was definelty one of the best sushi i've eaten in San Francisco and the Bay Area!  18 dishes came out and i was very full. About 200 dollars for the omakaze but well worth every dollar!

            "text": "We celebrated a close friend\u2019s bachelor party at Kusakabe with a dinner for nine. While the evening offered some incredible highlights, there were also a few unfortunate aspects that left us with mixed feelings about the experience.\n\nThe food was truly exceptional. Every dish was carefully crafted and elegantly presented, offering a range of delicate flavors and textures that impressed everyone in our group. The omakase journey was memorable, with standout courses like the uni that melted in the mouth and sparked admiration even from those in our party who are typically hesitant about raw seafood. The attention to detail in the preparation was evident, and the kitchen\u2019s talent shined through in every bite.\n\nWe also want to acknowledge the excellent service. Our group was significantly delayed due to travel complications, but the staff welcomed us with grace and understanding. They held our reservation without issue, served us with warmth and professionalism, and allowed us to enjoy the meal at our own pace. Their hospitality made us feel genuinely cared for.\n\nHowever, there were two major issues that deeply affected our overall impression. First, one of the sushi pieces contained a bone. This was both surprising and disappointing, particularly in a restaurant where precision is expected and the cost per person exceeds $200 before tax and gratuity. It disrupted the experience in a way that was hard to ignore.\n\nThe second and more disturbing issue was the presence of a cockroach on the wall behind our table. In any dining environment, this would be unacceptable. In a fine dining setting that charges premium prices and prides itself on offering a refined atmosphere, it was shocking. The sight of a cockroach near our table dampened what was otherwise a thoughtfully curated and beautifully served meal. We chose not to make a scene, but the image stayed with us for the rest of the night.\n\nDespite these setbacks, we had a wonderful evening in terms of the company, conversation, and culinary adventure. It was a joyful gathering that brought us closer together, and there were moments that we will fondly remember for years to come.\n\nKusakabe has remarkable food and a kind, accommodating staff. But fine dining is about more than what is served on the plate. We hope the restaurant takes this feedback seriously, because the potential for a flawless experience is certainly there, and it would be a shame for preventable issues to overshadow such culinary excellence.\n\nThe pictures of the bones and the cockroach is attached.",

We had a bunch of Nigiri, our favorite being chu toro, hamachi, and mackerel. But everything we had was high quality cuts. The rice was perfectly done as well, which I feel like that ingredient gets overlooked often. The wakame salad salad was fresh and absolutely delicious. We sat at the sushi bars and the chefs were so fun to watch and nice to chat with. The price is very fair for the quality you get here. We will absolutely be making this our new go to local sushi spot. Highly recommend!",

We've been to hole in the walls to Michelin starred restaurants, and this place has topped all of those experiences. You can see how much Chef Julio loves/enjoys his craft. He took his time to explain each dish in detail. Obviously, I was drunk with endorphins with each bite that I don't remember the names of all the pieces that we were pampered with. I did remember that each piece had different layers of flavors that never overpowered each other. They perfectly fused together in harmony. I overheard another patron say he just returned from Japan, and this place beats the quality there. I personally can't confirm that, but I can seriously say my wife enjoyed it so much. She told me we're ONLY coming back here for Omakase and nowhere else. Thank you, Chef, and see you again soon.",

The entire menu felt thoughtfully crafted, and the flavors were spot on. You can tell the chefs here really know what they\u2019re doing. We ordered multiple appetizers and entrees to share as well as all the desserts.  I wouldn't choose any dessert again as they were pretty mediocre\n\nThe ambiance is also top-tier. Sleek, modern, and upscale, but still warm and comfortable. It's the kind of place that feels special without being stuffy. Add to that an excellent spirits list with rare whiskies, great sake options, and inventive cocktails\u2014it\u2019s a dream for anyone who appreciates a good drink with their meal.\n\nOnly downside? The timing between courses was off. The brought our food to soon, making our business party of 6 feel overly rushed which  threw off the rhythm of the evening. And unfortunately, the restroom was in poor shape\u2014not what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nAll in all, Roku Akor is still 100% worth a visit for the food and vibe alone. Just hoping they tighten up service timing and take better care of the facilities next time. If they do, it\u2019s easily a 5-star spot!",

The food is exquisite: the ingredients are of the highest quality, the preparation is top-notch, and the flavour combinations are stunning. It\u2019s a wonderful combination of dishes, including sushi, though that\u2019s not the star of the show. Instead, the other dishes are the highlight of the evening: from the slow-cooked octopus to the sashimi and, most of all, the gyuoku banana cake. Incredible. The wagyu sushi, an addendum, is also marvellous, perfectly executed.\n\nThe service is also lovely. Everyone is incredibly friendly and attentive. A very minor comment is that all explanations about the courses were very standardised, including the speed of delivery (sometimes hard to follow), making it feel a tad less personal. But that\u2019s only for the explanations of the dishes\u2014other than that, it was really personal and intimate.\n\nThe ambience is also excellent. I will absolutely come here again.",

We tried an omakase course called \"The Oki.\"\n\nUnlike other high-end, Japanese-owned sushi restaurants in SF that import most of their fish from Tsukiji\u2014resulting in higher prices\u2014this place sources from various regions, like tuna from Mexico, allowing for more affordable pricing.\n\nI quickly noticed that their challenge lies in the fish and condiment pairings. At first glance, it looks like a traditional omakase, but I could sense some imbalance in flavors with certain nigiri. Of course, taste is subjective\u2014but personally, I still prefer the fish quality from Japan.

          "Really great experience! Fish quality was really incredible and the flavors were interesting. The uni toro hand roll was so fresh and delicious, almost ordered 2 but got too full. Only thing that wasn't outstanding was the dessert. Ice cream was a little too sweet and the malted cream flavor was a little meh."

Hot tip - lunch starts with standard Omakase (no \"a la carte\" menu\") but after Omakase service is complete, they offer you a menu to add on. We added the snapper, uni and wagyu and it was great! Lunchtime sake pairing was 4 generous, full glasses of sake and they were all delicious. Fun modern vibe, with sunlight but not \"too bright\".

Totally true! We ordered the sausage, papaya salad, cashew nut, pad thai and pad krapao ( last two not shown in the pictures). Everything was delicious. The waiters were very friendly. Regarding the price/quality, very reasonable. The only negative thing to mention, which is not related to the restaurant, is the fact that the neighborhood is full of people struggling with drug adiction in the streets. It is a bit shocking to see and if you come from abroad like us that we come from Europe, it was sad and confronting to see.",

I was pleased overall with my dining experience, and would return again for a nice occasion like dinner with parents or a celebration. The restaurant has limited capacity, but I found making a reservation online to book a large table quite simple. Moderate noise, but we were able to hear everyone at our table. Nothing too noteworthy about the service, even though I had reserved for a special occasion.\n\nFor our party of 8, we ordered 6 small plates and 3 large plates, and shared amongst each other. Great blend of flavors and textures. We really enjoyed a lot of the food. Favorites of the table were the crudo, the mussels, and the king salmon thai curry. Personally, I really enjoyed the pork jowl and the bronzino. It is quite impressive they were able to fillet the bronzino and maintain its shape for presentation.\n\nThe mio sparking sake and the sequoia nigori were our picks to pair with our food selection. Both were excellent with the meal, but the mio sparkling sake was definitely the favorite.\n\nAs for service, they seemed a little short staffed as there were only one waiter and another employee serving the drinks. I had to flag them a few times to refill our waters. And, it was tough getting their attention at times. However, the waiter was accommodating to the dietary needs at the table.",

          "A very cute and family oriented Thai spot in Sanfrans. Service is quick and very friendly. The food is exceptionally seasoned.Every dish was balanced and flavorful.  The food is well portioned with reasonable prices. Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. Well worth stopping a visit.",
          "I stopped by for Dinner, I started with basil beauty drink it\u2019s good it\u2019s just a little too sweet, papaya salad is good. Fresh roll is good too it could be better with less mixed greens which over power the rest of the ingredients, for the red curry is good could be better with a little bit more portion. Service was great, restaurant had good ambiance it\u2019s clean as well. Overall I recommend this place for Thai restaurants among the Thai restaurants if you\u2019re visiting SF.",
          "Really legit Thai food. Among the best!! Also a lot of great variety. Old standbys like Pad Kee Mao and Papaya Salad are amazing plus BBQ pork like nothing I ever had is super tasty. Love the condiments in case you want to dial up the heat even more."

With two whole pages of vegetarian and vegan options, this place is basically your new spiritual home.\n\nThe staff? Superstars. Friendly, attentive, and clearly running the show like a well-oiled family machine. They got me seated, sorted, and served faster than you can say \u201cPad Thai, please!\u201d\n\nFancy? Nope.

We also ordered the Chicken with Explosive Chili Pepper, which featured a generous amount of Szechuan chili peppers. It delivered that classic mouth-numbing sensation, but in a perfectly balanced way not overwhelming at all. The fried chicken pieces were seasoned perfectly and packed with flavor.\n\nOn top of the amazing food, the service stood out. Even though the place was busy, one of the servers took the time to explain the dish\u2019s origin and the best way to enjoy it, which made the whole experience even more special.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone craving authentic Chinese flavors especially the duck.

Everything was really good.\n\nMy favorite was the pan-fried dumplings, as I've never had that before. Just be careful as it does squirt everywhere if you bite into it. I liked the pork better than the beef dumpling. The cucumber was fresh, although I didn't really taste the garlic sauce. The xiao long bao was great, and the meat and sauce were very flavorful. Although personally, I thought they were on the bigger side. I prefer XLB that has an equal meat to pastry ratio. The green beans were perfectly crunchy.\n\nFor 6 dishes, tea and 1 beer, we paid ~$120 including tips. This is a good portion for 3 people.\n\nWould definitely come back again.",

Having a corner buildijg location allows for windows on both sides (better natural light and views), the acoustics were better than other spots (so you can actually hear the person next to you), and being in a great area allows for walking/hanging out or grabbing a dessert or tea afterward.",

          "I\u2019ve been to almost every dumpling spot in SF (my wife\u2019s a big fan \ud83d\ude02), so I\u2019d say I\u2019ve got a decent benchmark. This place is solid, definitely good, but not the best in the city.\n\nThe standout for me was the spicy pork soup dumpling, full of flavor and perfectly done. The sesame boiled dumpling was also above average. But the spicy beef boiled dumpling didn\u2019t quite hit the mark, bland and forgettable.\n\nBe ready for a wait, there\u2019s usually a line and it can take 20\u201330 minutes to get seated. Overall, worth trying, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a top dumpling destination.",
          "Went on a thursday night. Expect a wait if you come after 6:30 pm, they don't seat you until you have the full party.\n\nThat said, service was really quick once we sat down. We ordered the pork and beef pan-fried dumplings, pork xiao long bao, sauteed grean beans, cucumber, and the Zha Jiang noodles. Everything was really good.\n\nMy favorite was the pan-fried dumplings, as I've never had that before. Just be careful as it does squirt everywhere if you bite into it. I liked the pork better than the beef dumpling. The cucumber was fresh, although I didn't really taste the garlic sauce. The xiao long bao was great, and the meat and sauce were very flavorful. Although personally, I thought they were on the bigger side. I prefer XLB that has an equal meat to pastry ratio. The green beans were perfectly crunchy.\n\nFor 6 dishes, tea and 1 beer, we paid ~$120 including tips. This is a good portion for 3 people.\n\nWould definitely come back again.",
          "Dumpling Home offers authentic and delicious Chinese food that truly impressed me. The soup dumplings were outstanding \u2014 they held all the flavorful broth without breaking, which is a challenge even for restaurants in China. The small bites were refreshing, tasty, and full of variety. Despite the lunch rush, the business ran smoothly with efficient service. Highly recommend!"

There were several already waiting and standing in a distributed queue but once the doors were unlocked everyone seemed to know who got there first. There appear to be some dim sum favorites that are ready at 11am. One of them is the har gow which was promptly placed at our table right after we submitted our order sheet. The 5 star dishes were the shrimp dumpling (har gow), char siu crepe and the stir-fried green beans. The taro puff, tofu roulette, beef bao and 5-guys xiaolongbao were 4-stars. The condiments like Zhenjiang vinegar for xiaolongbao and red rice vinegar came served in shallow dishes upon request. There's nothing placed on the table to start. The service was quick with many people attending to food delivery, dish removal, hot water addition to our tea pot. The vibe of the place is lively and energetic because of the clientele that are meeting up with friends and family and work colleagues.",

At my age, it is hard to find something new. I've never heard of sand storm crab before. It was a deep fried crab with cilantro, minced garlic, scallions, peppers and fermented black beans. Fermented black beans is typically used in dishes like stir-fried clams. The sand storm crab was not bad. It was really oily. Still, tasty nevertheless. The other two dishes we had were the seafood crispy noodles $24 and honey pepper wings $13. Both were OK. The bonus was the free unexpected ice cream at the end of the meal. The restaurant is clean, no wait on a Tuesday night with excellent service and a speedy kitchen. Great meal.",

After looked at all the Google reviews of the whole Chinatown. We decided to go for this place and we made the right choice. The sizzling claypot dishes were hearty and delicious just what we needed for a cold day and the veggie stir-fry was so fresh and well cooked. Beef Chow Fun (rice noodle) was great with wok hey \u944a\u6c23 My dad called it the best meal since we have been away from home for 2 weeks. And the price is very reasonable too. Most importantly we made friend with the lady boss, she is so welcoming and looked after us well. She chatted with us the whole time talk about everything just like an old friend. We felt like home eating at her place so we went back again second night. Highly recommended for people if you look for an authentic Cantonese place and don\u2019t know where to go.

          "Absolutely fantastic food! I had the curry beef with rice, along with a hong Kong milk tea. Both just knocked it out of the park. Highly recommend!"

It is the best Cantonese restaurant in  San\nFrancisco. We arrived around 8 pm and we didn't have to wait. They took us to the underground part, which is an experience since it seems like you are entering another city. The service was excellent because the waiter was very patient since my English is not the best and he helped me choose the dishes. They welcomed us with tea, which they were very careful to serve. Afterwards, we ordered the duck, which was delicious, and the prawns with honey walnuts, which I also highly recommend because the combination of flavors is wonderful. The dessert was also delicious.

Mister Jius perfected the method by making the exterior crispy and the inside still medium rare and moist. We ordered the daikon cake with olive tapenade which was so unique. I don't usually like olive but the olives on top of the daikon cake elevated the taste. Their chow fun with charsiu came out piping hot, the way it should be. I feel like they made the noodle from scratch too. Good amount of soy sauce and flavor. Can never go wrong with milk bread and homemade soft honey butter.

Firstly, the costumer service is below decent standards given that the waiters didn't understand the concept of being friendly or polite, there was also a waiter that seemed to have a cold and wanted to demosntrate it to all of us. The atmosphere was chaotic and loud.

Among the 9 dishes, we like dumplings, sesame balls, and bean curd roll a lot. Sesame balls are a little expensive at $15, but they are the best I have had so far (I like dessert a lot). The place is comfy, the dim sum carts are all around you. The jasmine tea uses true high quality tea leaves that is one of the best in Chinese restaurants I have been to.

This restaurant beats any Indian restaurant in SF by any measure. The food is so tasty, so flavorful. The service is out of this world. The atmosphere is superb. The prices are extremely fair. As soon as we sat, they were bringing complimentary appetizers with some complimentary house sauces. Every food we had was 10/10. This is definitely paradise for food lovers. I have been to almost every Indian restaurant in the city, no restaurant comes even close to this one. I think Nepa restaurant is even better than some of the best Michellin Star Restaurants. I feel like royalty there. All staff members are absolutely friendly, smiling, very helpful. They are amazing people, both employees and even the owner. I have not enjoyed going to restaurant as much as I did going to Nepa. I am now \ud83d\udcaf loyal customer. Forget about any other restaurant l, come down here, you won\u2019t be disappointed ever. This is heaven for foodies. Restaurants, please take a note about how to run a restaurant from Nepa. Learn from them. Cuz this is how you do it. Thank you Nepa Team for taking absolutely amazing care of your customers. We see you Nepa Team",

We felt very much welcome and felt at home in this place because of Janarthan who was very polite and friendly who speaks English as well as Hindi and Nepali . This was the best Indian restaurant serving the most authentic Indian food I ever had at n this part of USA. I loved the lamb curry suggested by the friendly Janarthan who took our orders. The fried momos were beyond words as I always have steamed momos. The tandoori platter, garlic naan all other items were perfect in taste catering to our Indian buds. Spice was adjusted to our needs. The complimentary masala tea Janarthan offered me as I spoke a bit of Nepali was out of the world. Ambience was great with Bollywood songs playing on the TV in the background to take the experience to another level. Would be my place to go whenever I think of Indian food . The gulab Jamuns to wind up the dinner were perfect.",

          "Oh boy, I don\u2019t even know where to start. This restaurant is by far the best Indian & Nepalese restaurant that I have ever been to anywhere. This restaurant beats any Indian restaurant in SF by any measure. The food is so tasty, so flavorful. The service is out of this world. The atmosphere is superb. The prices are extremely fair. As soon as we sat, they were bringing complimentary appetizers with some complimentary house sauces. Every food we had was 10/10. This is definitely paradise for food lovers. I have been to almost every Indian restaurant in the city, no restaurant comes even close to this one. I think Nepa restaurant is even better than some of the best Michellin Star Restaurants. I feel like royalty there. All staff members are absolutely friendly, smiling, very helpful. They are amazing people, both employees and even the owner. I have not enjoyed going to restaurant as much as I did going to Nepa. I am now \ud83d\udcaf loyal customer. Forget about any other restaurant l, come down here, you won\u2019t be disappointed ever. This is heaven for foodies. Restaurants, please take a note about how to run a restaurant from Nepa. Learn from them. Cuz this is how you do it. Thank you Nepa Team for taking absolutely amazing care of your customers. We see you Nepa Team",
          "I had a great lunch at Nepa! Lots of vegetarian options and I was happily surprised by the flavor of the Jeera Aloo. Very yummy! Excited to come back again and try more.",
          "Nice casual environment. Food was incredible, over ordered to the point of scared. The Hot is perfectly spiced, I debated going higher but what am I trying to prove?\n- lamb biryani\n- chicken Tikka masala\n- garlic naan\n- Momo's\n\nMomo's we're incredible, a surprise highlight on top of a delicious meal."

This was one of them.\n\nWe had the pepper chicken fry dosa and king fish curry with idiyappam, a pairing my wife recommended over my usual naan. Firstly, the combination of dosa with a flavorful chicken curry is underrated, instantly bringing back comforting memories of home. The king fish curry was also beautifully balanced, hitting that perfect spot between tangy and spicy. The fish itself was perhaps a touch chewy, and nailing the temperature could elevate this dish even further. What impressed me most was that nothing felt overpowering or heavy, leaving you feeling satisfied rather than needing to wash it all down.\n\nBeyond the delicious food, the owners, Kamala and Durgaprasad, were incredibly gracious and warm, and their story was inspiring. I sincerely hope their passion and tireless dedication reach many more people.",

          "Marina Indian Cuisine was such a great find! We ordered the gobi manchurian, butter chicken, and paneer tikka masala\u2014and everything hit the spot. The gobi manchurian had the perfect crisp and flavor, while the butter chicken was super creamy and rich. The paneer tikka masala was also packed with flavor and had just the right amount of spice. What really stood out, though, was the service\u2014genuinely kind and attentive the whole way through. To top it all off, they surprised us with rice pudding at the end, which was a really sweet touch (literally). Definitely recommend stopping by if you\u2019re craving some solid Indian food!",
          "Very mediocre food with mediocre service. My food was mostly plain. The waitress was talking very quietly, I could barely hear her even though it was completely silent in the restaurant. I don\u2019t recommend this place but maybe your food choice will be better than mine. Their menu is huge and I\u2019m sure people can find something they like. I was probably not lucky that time",
          "Really enjoyed the chicken palak and aloo paratha we had here. Chicken was in large pieces and tasted stewed\u2014very comforting. Loved the spiced potato in the paratha. Bhengan barta was also nice and butter naan ties it all together.\n\nGetting a mild curry is indeed very mild. Would recommend getting medium if you want a little heat, though it was delicious even without.\n\nReally friendly service and large portions. Looking forward to coming back."

          "Came here without a reservation on a weekend for lunch. We were seated quickly. The samosas were really good. The breads were huge. The curries definitely packed heat. The ice cream cubes to top off the meal were cute, milky, and sweet.",
          "Visited on a weekday night with a friend. We had the chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, papadum and the wings. I also got the mango lassi which was so so good. Everything was so delicious and we've tried a couple of Indian restaurants in SF already -- this was truly outstanding! It was pretty affordable, service was quick and friendly. We will definitely be back.",
          "Came here to dine on a Friday evening with some friends. The food tasted very good, especially the garlic naan bread which we thoroughly enjoyed. The starters and the choices of curries was also plentiful.\n\nThe only downside was an unpleasant smell originating from the bathroom and the pretty long wait for the food to arrive."

After a chat with the server who was polite and helpful I went for the Chicken tikka masala (CTM) and a garlic naan. I swerved the free poppadom as it was a little/ way too soft for my liking.. The CTM actually tasted pretty good albeit very different to the UK original, the meat was a little unimpressive and lacked the freshness I was hoping for. The naan, if slightly thin and crispy in places, tasted pretty good and the whole affair was washed down with a bottle of Taj Magal - Decent! Really I\u2019d give this a 3.5 if a could, but that would be a solid 3.5 and up against some polished competition so by no means a poor score: if you\u2019re in the area and have an Indian flavoured itch to scratch, you good do a lot worse..",

My favorite Tika masala, nan , and rice. Tikaasala wasn't good at all. Or maybe they put me Butter masala, since I noticed they have it in menu and saw on rewies. It was not seasoned enough not runny not the right texture and the chicken extremely overcooked. I just tasted a bit and put aside all good. Maybe I will give it to some homeless person or toss it away. It was very disappointing when the restaurant that I always enjoy makes such mistakes. If you see your food not the same or taste wrong I understand you guys don't want to lose money and try to sell it but always remember you will lose clients. I am not sure I will order more here.

          "Great place to bring friends, family or even a date.  Most of the food and drinks my friends and I ordered were delicious. The only entree that I didn't enjoy was their fajitas, they were under seasoned and lacked flavor. Definitely have to order the calamari, that red sauce is soo good \ud83d\ude01. The Al Pastor torta was packed with flavor and the fried chicken nachos were different in a good and delicious way. Service was good, but keep in mind that the restaurant is on the small side so there may be a bit of a wait for larger parties. Definitely coming back again!",
          "Chicken Fajitas (white meat) are outstanding!! And trust me on this one , I\u2019ve been too hundreds of placing in search for good fajitas , and this one is definitely in my top 2 , try it try it. You will love it. Restaurant is located in a little funky neighbourhood, go and explore it.",
          "Super delicious. The food tasted amazing and the place had a great vibe. Usually I want to add more hot sauce or salsa to taco salads,  but this was perfect as is. Super affordable for a sit-down place. 10/10"

You don\u2019t get any rice in the burritos, and instead, you get the juiciest pieces of meat and a good portion of it too!\n\nFrom time to time we get the quesadilla and those are super good too. It\u2019s a little more oilier than the burritos since they make the tortillas super crispy but hits the spot. There\u2019s usually a long line but it usually moves quickly.",

We had the super burrito fried the proportion sizes is not that large but it is worth every bit of the money. There was a pretty big line but trust me don't let that scare you away it goes really fast. The inside is pretty small so it's hard to get a table so we just got to go and ate it at our car.",
          "The chicken tacos were ordinary.\nThe meat did not have any flavors. It was just boiled chicken and beans.\nThe tacos being boiled chicken with the sauce were extremely soggy.\n\nSame was the case with the burrito. No flavor and extremely soggy. Making it difficult to eat.\n\nFor 5.2$, I would definitely not visit this place again. Definitely overpriced.\nThe salsa did not have any flavors either.\nThis is just an overrated busy place.\nDefinitely not worth the hype and popularity.\nWould definitely not visit again",

Highly recommend the chicharrones in red sauce, but you can't go wrong with any choice.

As the 45 minutes passed we got a text message saying that table was ready; then the waitress said she wanted to know if we were still around\u2026 another 50 minutes passed and they didn\u2019t even tell us what was going on, after multiple times asking they gave us a menu and told us \u201cyou have to order now, and you may be seated in 30 more minutes\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why they play like that, I\u2019d rather if they tell me: \u201cwaiting list is 2 hours\u201d then I could decide, but playing with customers time is the worst. Definitely not coming back ever, and not recommend to any people I know, sad because the food is good.",

            "text": "I have been here for a couple of times in the last few years and this place is legit for kalbijjim. I came here on a Friday around 545PM for two people. As I arrived, the small tables for two people were filling up very quickly. Luckily I got seated right away. After 6PM, you need to wait in line, so I highly suggest to come here 5 to 6 PM. Yes it is early for dinner unless you don't mind to wait. To me, I hate waiting. Lol. I ordered B2 which was Premium Kalbijjim with regular size. This portion definitely can fill up more than 2 people. I also added extra rice cake and cheese. Both add-ons were 11 bucks. The cheese itself seemed  to be worth it, but not for the extra rice cake. I counted the total and it was like 10 pcs, so basically a handful.  The short rib was well tender and cooked. The services were on point and efficient. As soon as we were done, we paid and left because I didn't want others to wait too long. I suggest you do the same and don't sit and chat after you finished eating. It's a common courtesy. I also recommend to park at the Jtown plaza because street parking spaces are limited due to high volume of cars. I definitely come back to try other food on the menu like Seolleong Tang and Mandu Guk. Big fan. Keep up the good work!",

This second time we got the premium kalbijjim (large, mild, cheese) and it was intense, flavorful, unbelievably good. The short rib meat was so tender. Each bite was bursting with flavor. Whenever we come back to SF, we will come once again!",
          "Came with a group of friends for dinner. Make sure to check the wait time ahead, it can get really busy! Servers come quickly to take your orders and the food comes just as fast. Had the Kalbitang which was fantastic, hot and full of flavour. The sides are very tasty as well, you'll be full from everything there. Definitely recommend giving it a try if you like Korean food!",
          "A couple friends recommended this place and decided to visit with my family. It was their first time trying kalbijjim. We got the large one with extra cheese as well as some mandu and it was enough for the four of us.\n\nIt was very tasty and well served and reminded me of the one I had when I was living in Korea.\n\nWe ended up paying around 130 bucks for the four of us."

Not bad, but not particularly impressive either \u2014 slightly below what I was expecting.\n\nThe sauce on the sashimi salad was decent, and the chicken soup was a bit salty without much of that rich chicken flavor.

          "I came to try this popular restaurant inside the Korean supermarket. There was no wait \u2014 we were seated right away. Although it\u2019s located in a supermarket, the atmosphere was decent and actually felt quite formal.\n\nThe service was excellent \u2014 the staff were very friendly and welcoming, always smiling. I forgot the server\u2019s name, but I think it might have been Yao or something similar, a three-letter name starting with \u201cY.\u201d\n\nAs for the food, everything looked great, but the taste was just okay. Not bad, but not particularly impressive either \u2014 slightly below what I was expecting.\n\nThe sauce on the sashimi salad was decent, and the chicken soup was a bit salty without much of that rich chicken flavor. The beef short ribs were fine, though they weren\u2019t served hot \u2014 more lukewarm \u2014 but tasted good with the spicy mayo and soybean paste.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience. The service definitely added a positive touch.",
          "Unexpected gem in Serramonte!\n\nWe walked in with zero expectations and left planning our next visit. The food was excellent across the board and the service was truly above and beyond \u2014 friendly, attentive, and on-point with suggestions.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the beef barbecue: tender, deeply flavorful, and perfectly cooked \u2014 outstanding. The fresh bread was a fun, unexpected win (warm and dangerously good). I also tried abalone for the first time \u2014 clean, buttery, and beautifully prepared.\n\nGreat timing, dishes arrived unexpectedly fast. Highly recommend Pogu if you\u2019re anywhere near Serramonte.",
          "My family and I came in for a celebration and chose to get the Chef's Choice menu. Overall, the menu was well balanced, tasty and excellent quality. All the ingredients were fresh and seasoned well. Service was great, very attentive and accommodating. I'd recommend this place for a low-key date night if you're looking for a great Korean menu."

Again, the vibes are good and the patio is a plus as it makes it dog friendly. Doesn't really feel like an authentic Korean place and it's a bit like they are trying too hard to be hip but maybe that's what sells. I recommend making reservations as it can get busy during prime time.\n\nThe service is ... usually sub par. Even on our best visit, it was still lacking. I want to be charitable and assume they are just severely understaffed. You'll often have a hard time getting a hold of them and even if you do, expect to remind them multiple times for requests. They've made it so you can now order on your phone but for any special requests, it's the same issue.\n\nThe food is pricey but a few of the dishes are actually worth it. Haven't visited in a while but apparently now they charge for extra banchan (side dishes)... what? I know times are tough but damn.\n\nWhile the patio atmosphere is nice and the location is convenient for many, there are better Korean spots even in SF (and much, much better in the Bay in general).\n\nOverall, the place is good but not great and while the atmosphere is lovely, things like the insufficient level of service and the inconsistent quality of the dishes makes it hard to make this a must visit for anyone.",

The food is good but not great, partially due to the prices to portion ratio.\n\nWe ordered teokkboki, LA galbi, beef bulgogi, pork belly, kimchi fried rice, bibimbap. Everything was well cooked. Galbi wasn\u2019t too fatty and was delish, bulgogi was slightly too sweet but still tasty, kimchi fried rice lacked seasoning or taste, bibimbap had a unique western take on it, pork belly was mid.\n\nOne disappointing thing - banchan (small side dish) isn\u2019t free flow - it\u2019s just season quails eggs, spiced broccoli, yellow pickled radish and kimchi. It\u2019s disappointing considering these are inexpensive sides even from a restaurant owner perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve dined here on multiple occasions, I\u2019d personally recommend: LA galbi, scallion pancake, soonduboo jjigae, rock n roe rice and charred gai lon.\n\nService staff were good! We enjoyed our food and service, just oddly underwhelmed by needing to pay for side dishes which are free flow in majority of the Korean joints I\u2019ve been to. It\u2019s not a big deal, just in principle?\n\nWould come again if I\u2019m in the area. Total came to about $50+ per person with tips.",

I don't think I've ever left a review for a restaurant before, but I felt compelled after the incredibly attentive and respectful staff served us what is arguably the most deliciously balanced and  well portioned Italian meal we've ever had, at a compelling price point. The focaccia was beautifully baked, with interesting and delicate flavors that gave us an idea of what we had gotten ourselves into. Followed shortly thereafter by absolutely delectable duck liver pate and apricot crostinis. But the stars of the show were definitely the squid ink pasta and the raviolini. They were both superb: light but complex, savory but not too rich, and just enough on the plate to sate your hunger.

The polenta was soft and tasty, and the mushrooms and cheese on top were great. I enjoyed the wine sauce on it as well.

Cute atmosphere, very friendly staff, prompt service, and I just felt right at home there. If you're gluten free and vegetarian or pescetarian, they have some great options!

As soon as you walk in, the staff was speaking Italian, a gentleman was working ravioli sheets and you just knew from that point this place was going to be legit and it did not disappoint at all. Found another reason worth coming back to SF and this place is it. Going to try their other locations during my next visit!",

From the very beginning, she was noticeably unfriendly \u2014 she interrupted me while I was placing my order and kept rushing me, even though there was only one couple behind us who were still deciding what to get. It felt like she was deliberately speaking fast and harshly just to make it clear we weren\u2019t welcome. It was unpleasant and unnecessary.\nLater, she was the one who brought our food. She acted like she didn\u2019t see us and just slammed the plates down on the table. That kind of attitude is unacceptable. I also noticed in the comments that many other people have complained about this same blonde woman \u2014 so it\u2019s clearly not a one-time issue. It\u2019s a shame, because the food was genuinely delicious, and the dark-haired guy and girl were really friendly and kind. They created a nice atmosphere, and if it weren\u2019t for the rude behavior of the cashier, our overall impression would have been completely different.",

We use to go 3 to 4 times a month and the food and service was always outstanding, and I always ordered Pavarotti or #7 as it use to be referred as!  However, this time was very disappointed and I am sure Pablo didn\u2019t make it and one of the sous chefs cooked it for me.   Unlike 30 years ago, the prosciutto and sun-dried tomatoes were barely visible this time, and there was very little flavor.  Such a disappointment with such high expectations! \ud83d\ude41 Then they brought us an order of tiramisu as a gift to celebrate our 30 anniversary, very nice gesture, however, when I received the bill they charged me for the dessert! Are you kidding me!  Well, no need to come back again!  I have great memories of great food, with great friends, unfortunately not this time! Thanks for the memories!",

It was good but not like any food I had had before. My only issue was my tuna that I got for my main course was a little over cooked. Definitely a great experience.

          "I did the 4 course and here are my takeaways:\n\n1. I was worried it wouldn\u2019t be enough food and I would need to get In N Out after.  It was.  The portions are bigger and they add extras.\n\n2. Great way to experience Michelin without doing the full thing.  Experience was 3 hours.\n\n3. Service was 10/10, wine pairing was 9/10, presentation was 10/10, food was 7/10\n\nOverall great experience and worth the steep price. If you are just looking for great food, however, there are much better options in the neighborhood that are half the price.  You are paying for the full experience (atmosphere, service, presentation, etc).",
          "This was a great location for us to celebrate my wife\u2019s birthday. The service was absolutely unbelievable. Honestly it was so good it almost got annoying. My water glass never was less than 3/4 full and any time you left the table you napkin was refreshed. The food was beautiful and totally different than I had ever experienced. It was good but not like any food I had had before. My only issue was my tuna that I got for my main course was a little over cooked. Definitely a great experience. Also definitely as expensive as I thought it would be. It was easy to walk to from our hotel on union square.",
          "The Michelin experience for a late night champagne tasting was excellent in terms of service and ambiance. However some of the small appetizers felt as though they\u2019ve been sitting there for quite a while and were very obviously end of the night leftovers as there was a slight fishy and or slight staleness in them. Notably, the caviar and champagne tasted exquisite and the service was impeccable. The personalized touches such that of the letter and birthday dessert certainly added to the experience."

Yummy!\n\nAfter that, we ordered the sand dabs with spinach and steamed mussels. Wow!  Huge portions of delicious food. The sand dabs were sweet and flavored with lemon.

          "Fantastic warm welcome from stepping in the door. My family were seated immediately and service was so friendly throughout our visit to a lovely Mediterranean jewel in North Beach. Excellent food, very authentic cuisine, just what we wanted as a family on holiday travelling California. So good to dine in a locally owned restaurant and not have processed burgers/American food available. As tourists visiting from the UK would highly recommended. Thanks for the great experience on our last night.",
          "Food was amazing and portions were huge!!! I had chicken wrap and it came with a yogurt sauce which was delicious. Absolutely loved it and will come back if my family is gonna be in San Francisco again. Our waiter, Oscar is incredible, he gave off a great energy and he is extra nice!!!",
          "Dear local people if you live around this gem i recommend you come here. The fresh ingredients you can taste with every BITE. This was delicious and full of flavors. I drove here all the way from mill valley and it was worth the drive. I can\u2019t wait to come back."

The taramosalata, typical of the Greek mezedes, was disappointing, very flavorless. The kokkinisto with lamb shank excellent. The loukoumades (doughnut balls) were disappointing, not crispy on the outside.\nI have cut marks on atmosphere because of two things. Greek hospitality, filoxenia, is famous; it was completely missing. The service was what you would expect at a good restaurant, no more. Simple Greek greetings such as \"kalosorizete\" (welcome) and \"styn iyeia sas\" (to your health) after pouring the drinks would have made it more authentic. And the \"kerasma\" (typically a simple dessert) on the house, so inherent to the Greek culture was completely missing.",

Each small dish felt thoughtfully prepared from the creamy cheeses and honey to the vibrant olives and fresh fruits. The scrambled eggs with sausage (sucuk) were fluffy and perfectly seasoned, and the warm, fluffy pita slices were the perfect match. Their spinach and cheese b\u00f6rek was a real highlight too flaky, savory, and topped with a light sprinkle of sesame seeds.\n\nThe presentation alone is worth mentioning everything came out so colorful and inviting. (See the photos!)\n\nThe staff were friendly, attentive, and made the experience even better. The cozy atmosphere and beautiful wooden tables made it feel like a true Turkish home.\n\nHighly recommend Lokma for anyone craving a vibrant and hearty breakfast it's truly one of the best breakfast experiences I've had in the Bay Area!\n\nFavorite bites:\n\nSucuklu Yumurta (Turkish sausage with scrambled eggs)\n\nSpinach B\u00f6rek\n\nHomemade jams and olives\n\nThank you, Lokma team -- can't wait to come back!",

The falafel wrap seemed kind of spicy, but not a flavor spice more of an ingredient spice, couldn't make out what that was. The hummus came with a giant tortilla instead of actual pita. The salad didn't have any dressing, and the kibbe seem more like a kabob that actual baked kibbe itself. The tzatziki as a side cost $8 which for just wanting a little bit of a side sauce seem like a little excessive. We didn't get any utensils with our order and it was stapled together by the restaurant before our driver delivered it to us.\nFor a restaurant with such a high rating and the high prices  I don't know if they were having an off day or if they cater to dine-in customers more so than delivery but I certainly would not go back again.",

I must have walked by a dozen times and I feel like a complete fool for not giving them a shot sooner. The food is phenomenal. First off, the dolma was the best I\u2019ve ever had in my life. Seems simple, rice wrapped in grape leaves, right? But it was exceptional. The lamb kebab was delicious, the veggies were buttery and garlicky and perfectly cooked, the rice was flavorful, and that whole roasted tomato was like a nostalgia bomb that brought me back to my childhood. The restaurant itself is really nice too (they don\u2019t always have little skeleton farmers atop the bar but hey it\u2019s Halloween), and the staff is attentive and friendly. Stop scrolling around trying to figure out what you want to eat tonight. You found it, this is it.",

          "Fantastic halal Mediterranean restaurant! The lamb shank was amazing! Everything else we tried was delicious as well. Fast, friendly service. Seated immediately for lunch on a Sunday. Accommodating to young children. Highly recommended!",
          "With my wife being Lebanese we have tried Mediterranean and the like types of food all across the world and I'd have to say that this experience as we were traveling to the Bay Area certainly was disappointing.\nThe grape leaves AKA dolmas had lemon and honey drizzled over them - that was a first. The falafel wrap seemed kind of spicy, but not a flavor spice more of an ingredient spice, couldn't make out what that was. The hummus came with a giant tortilla instead of actual pita. The salad didn't have any dressing, and the kibbe seem more like a kabob that actual baked kibbe itself. The tzatziki as a side cost $8 which for just wanting a little bit of a side sauce seem like a little excessive. We didn't get any utensils with our order and it was stapled together by the restaurant before our driver delivered it to us.\nFor a restaurant with such a high rating and the high prices  I don't know if they were having an off day or if they cater to dine-in customers more so than delivery but I certainly would not go back again.",
          "Exceptionally nice food, high quality service. The marinated chicken kebab was one of the nicest I\u2019ve tasted, succulent and moist and the basmati rice was cooked to perfect, very many thanks for making my dining experience so nice."

We ordered lentil soup and a plate of gyros.  As we were waiting for food, I noticed that the kitchen was almost missing.  I am not even sure if there is any burner or any proper cooking equipment. That is not a good sign!  The food came out quickly, probably because there is no cooking done in the back.  The lentil soup was very sour (too much lemon?) and lacked flavor.    I feel like nothing is fresh there.\nThey should change the name to something that represents \"Turkish shop selling food/snacks.\" There is nothing close to a bistro.",

          "Tried Scomas\u2019s when I was in San Francisco. Restaurant is near the waterfront and is busy most of the time. Reservation is recommended. Food taste and quality is good. Staffs are courteous and service was quick. Ordered the fish and chips, crab cake, and salmon. Taste is good and quantity is good. Price is on the higher side since the food is fresh and  restaurant is located in a busy area.",
          "The service was excellent. The server was personable and knowledgeable about the menu, including the wine. The three of us really enjoyed our meals. There was nothing that I didn\u2019t enjoy. I had the pacific snapper. It was \u201comg\u201d delicious. This is definitely a place that I would frequent if I lived in the area.",
          "Amazing food here!\nCioppino was great as expected, but the shrimp & scallop was unexpectedly so delightful to eat! It had very nice taste of lemon and butter, and cooked very well so the texture of each ingredients were nice."

So many choices for good seafood, but we will surely go here again when we return.  My wife had the seafood linguine in tomato cream and I the cioppino. Mine had 1/2 a crab and was so large I thought it was for two. I ate it all! Thankfully, they had bibs. This cioppino is finger food and will decorate the tablecloth, napkins and you! So good! We both finished our plates, which is rare these days. The staff were attentive, suggestions spot on and the owner was very nice, sharing stories of his life and career.

          "On a seafood recommendation by a resident my wife and I had a wonderful experience here. We were visiting The City for her birthday, having lived here many years ago. So many choices for good seafood, but we will surely go here again when we return.  My wife had the seafood linguine in tomato cream and I the cioppino. Mine had 1/2 a crab and was so large I thought it was for two. I ate it all! Thankfully, they had bibs. This cioppino is finger food and will decorate the tablecloth, napkins and you! So good! We both finished our plates, which is rare these days. The staff were attentive, suggestions spot on and the owner was very nice, sharing stories of his life and career. Thank you Hector and all the staff. Looking forward to our next meal!",
          "I like the eclectic decor. Sometimes breezy if someone leaves one of the doors open. Cioppino is definitely the way to go. I liked the large shrimp and scallops especially. Risotto was okay but a little under for the rice. Seafood was fresh. Bread was good. I could see why they charge for additional",
          "**A Solid Seafood Experience at Betty Lou\u2019s Seafood Grill**\n\nBetty Lou\u2019s Seafood Grill offers a **pleasant dining experience in the heart of San Francisco**, delivering fresh seafood with thoughtful preparation. While the **clam chowder was thinner** than expected, it still carried a decent flavor that complemented the meal.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was the **large prawns in butter sauce**, an entr\u00e9e that truly stood out. The prawns were **perfectly cooked** and paired beautifully with the accompanying potatoes, creating a rich and satisfying dish.\n\nService was **decent** throughout our visit\u2014not extraordinary, but efficient enough to ensure a smooth meal.\n\nOverall, Betty Lou\u2019s is a **good seafood restaurant**, providing enjoyable flavors without going over the top. If you\u2019re looking for a casual spot with well-prepared seafood, it\u2019s certainly worth considering."

I thought lets give it a shot, since we're headed to the city anyways, more specifically to the Dutch Windmill area of Golden Gate Park.\n\nWe placed our order at Hook Fish around 1:15 PM on a Sunday afternoon. Nothing elaborate or excessive. We were told to expect a 40 minute wait! Well...it was a bit arduous to back out now, considering we parked three blocks away and walked about 10 minutes, then waited another 10 minutes in line to order. Speaking off...Hook Fish is basically in the middle of the neighborhood, so parking it very challenging. The venue is tiny, no room inside to sit down, it does have an open kitchen where you can see your feed being made. There is a small restroom inside and there is some compact outdoor seating right outside the venue.\n\n#HookFish:\n~ Fish and Chips - 4/5\nYour standard Fish and Chips with seasoned fries. Beer battered with housemade tartar sauce. Good, but not amazing or to die for...\n\n~ Tacos - 4/5\nGood Fish Tacos with plenty of things going on... -`Avocado, pico de gallo, pickled slaw, spicy aioli in housemade corn tortillas (order of 2)\n\n~ HABA\u00d1ERO CARROT - 5/5\nIt's all about the Sauce!! This stuff is brilliant! Not too Spicy with a very unique flavor profile. DELISH!!\n\nHook Fish is good, just not not worth a 40 minute to hour plus wait...\nThere are plenty of similar options available.\n\nI'd stop by again if the wait wasn't terrible, but I don't fell like missed out on anything if I didn't make it out to Hook Fish...",

It would be helpful if they could either stop the line at a certain point or let people know earlier that dine-in may no longer be available.

That way, people at the end of the line won\u2019t waste time standing there for nothing. Just a simple system like that would really help manage expectations.\n\nThat said, the food is still excellent.

It was good, though after the garlic shrimp I found myself wishing it had more spice.\n\nMy honey had the crab ravioli, it was great, with a wonderful sauce.

          "We were in town for business and decided to give Fog Harbor a try\u2026 we were not disappointed!  To start off, our servers Alex and Dom were amazing.  Friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.\n\nBecause I had to, I tried their clam chowder. It was good, one of the better chowders I have had.\n\nWe had the red chili garlic shrimp as an appetizer, and it was fantastic\u2026 I\u2019ll warn you, ask for more bread because you don\u2019t want t to waste that amazing sauce!\n\nFor our mains, I had the cioppino. It was good, though after the garlic shrimp I found myself wishing it had more spice.\n\nMy honey had the crab ravioli, it was great, with a wonderful sauce. Be ready, there is a mound of crab on top, so go hungry.\n\nOverall, a great experience, you definitely need to give this place a try.",
          "What an incredible dining experience! We were seated by a window with a breathtaking view of the ocean, made even more special by the sight of sea lions playing in the water.\n\nThe service was top-notch from start to finish. A special thank you to our server, David Q, who made our meal truly memorable. He patiently answered our questions about the menu, timed each course perfectly so we could savor our food without feeling rushed or crowded, and even validated our parking.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious, from the clam chowder and mussel fries to the main courses. The calamari was perfectly soft, and both the swordfish and salmon were cooked to absolute perfection. Don't miss out on their Golden Sunset and Strawberry Lemonade, either. A fantastic meal in an unbeatable location!",

We were one of the few who arrived at restaurant open and we made reservation ahead of time, we would want patio outdoor seating. The waitress led us to a table as far as possible from water front, and told us that that was our table. Meanwhile at least ten group of other guests got seated as close as they could get to water front. Waitress didn\u2019t ask us about preference or anything, I feel we got  judged based on our appearance.\n\n2. Through out the two hour dinning, our waiter never ever spared us a smile, even under the circumstances that our baby tried very hard to stare and smile at him multiple times. He got this attitude like it was our honor to be served by him. In the end we leave him 18% tip (because we were not so happy), he even greeted us goodbye with a strict face.\nWe were happy with all other people in the restaurant, especially one lady who helped clean our table, she smiled a lot.\n\nOf course service doesn\u2019t have a perfect measurement, but as customers, we did feel we deserved to be treated better.",

We ordered the 4 different subs, and they were all delicious - my favorite was the Molinari special. Prices were around $16 per sub, which is definitely big enough for one person. They cut it in half so you can exchange with your friend/family if you wanna try multiple subs.\n\nAs you walk in, you\u2019ll feel as if you were transported to Italy. The whole store is filled with imported food goods from Italy and it\u2019s a great vibe that gets your appetite going. They also slice the deli meat in front of you for some cool showmanship.\n\nMake sure to grab a ticket as soon as you walk in, as they\u2019ll call your number to take orders at the counter. The wait might be 20-30 mins depending on the day and time. If you are low on time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an essential spot to visit as I\u2019m sure there are other lesser known spots with just as good subs.",

Perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, each bite was a delightful blend of flavors. The rich, buttery Parmesan complemented the robust garlic notes beautifully, creating a savory sensation that left my taste buds dancing with joy. The wings were generously coated, ensuring that every morsel was packed with flavor. It's clear that great care was taken in their preparation, resulting in wings that are nothing short of perfection.\n\nAccompanying the wings was a refreshing Greek salad that provided the perfect balance to the rich flavors of the chicken. The salad was a vibrant medley of fresh ingredients: crisp lettuce, juicy tomatoes, crunchy cucumbers, and tangy red onions, all tossed in a light, zesty dressing. The feta cheese added a creamy texture, while the olives gave a delightful briny punch. Every bite was a harmonious blend of textures and tastes, making it a standout dish in its own right.\n\nThe exceptional food was only matched by the phenomenal customer service at The Hungry Spot. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a friendly atmosphere. The staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about providing an excellent dining experience. They went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my meal was perfect, making me feel like a valued guest.\n\nIn summary, my dining experience at The Hungry Spot was truly remarkable. The garlic Parmesan chicken wings and Greek salad were outstanding, each dish crafted with care and bursting with flavor. The customer service was exemplary, adding an extra layer of enjoyment to the meal. I highly recommend this place to anyone seeking delicious food and outstanding service.",

          "ABSOLUTE MUST-TRY! This was by far the best muffuletta I have ever had! While it is a little pricey, the combo makes it so worth it and it is well worth the price regardless! Cookie are also incredibly delicious too! The staff here were super friendly and attentive. This is a small business and is really pushing the neighborhood forward! I cannot think that I could recommend this place any stronger. Definitely a must-have when visiting San Francisco!",
          "Didn't get their famous muffaletta but tried their egg sandwich and cookie. Cookie was amazing, kinda pricey at $5 but worth it for the size and quality. Egg sandwich, while good, didn't feel like it fully justified the $14 price tag. Not the most complex flavor and just put between two pieces of regular white bread.\n\nEven with that though the customer service was great, and if I'm ever around there again I will stop by for a cookie.",
          "Sandwich was A1 but the cookies oh my goodness, absolutely unreal.\n\nAnd the owner recommended a few great spots with a view to eat it for which we were super grateful!"

I strolled in with high hopes and emerged victorious with a milkshake that\u2019s basically liquid gold: sea salt caramel as the silky base, crowned with two scoops of their olive oil ice cream. Olive oil in ice cream? It sounds like a madcap plot twist, but it delivers; creamy with a whisper of earthy savoriness that dances with the caramel like old flames rekindling. Each slurp was a symphony of rich, balanced bliss. I felt like I\u2019d unlocked a secret level in the game of desserts.\nBut wait, the drama unfolds: the straw. And hey, \u201cStraw\u201d is literally in their name... talk about irony! This biodegradable bad boy decided to split clean down the middle quicker than a celebrity couple in tabloid headlines. One moment it\u2019s heroically tackling the thick shake; the next, it\u2019s in two pieces, forcing me to improvise like a survivalist in the wilderness. Ended up tilting the cup back like I was toasting the gods. Pro tip: pack a backup straw forged from adamantium, or just lean into the mess.\nEven with the straw\u2019s split-second betrayal, this was an epic win. Salt & Straw, you\u2019re the flavor wizard I didn\u2019t know I needed. 5 stars, no notes, because who needs perfection when you\u2019ve got pure, chaotic joy? \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

            "text": "This ice cream shop benefits greatly from its prime location in a key shopping area, close to several city venues, and it does offer a water station and restroom, which are definite pluses. While the shop boasts some interesting and more exotic ice cream flavors that might tempt adventurous palates, the overall experience left something to be desired.\n\nThe employees were polite and met basic customer service expectations, but their apparent preoccupation with socializing amongst themselves didn't foster a sense of enthusiastic assistance. Parking is also a significant drawback. While street parking is available, the prices felt outrageously high, and the nearest garage is a few blocks away.\n\nPerhaps the most unsettling aspect was the emptiness of the store. Despite having shelves and coolers, they were largely bare, giving off an odd, almost going-out-of-business vibe. This unfortunately made the grubbiness of the walls quite noticeable.\n\nPersonally, the shop felt like it was trying too hard to cultivate a cool and trendy image without fully delivering on it. While the availability of some unique flavors elevates it beyond a three-star rating, the numerous downsides prevent it from reaching a four. It has potential, but it just not there.",

Many flavors, in fact, probably the majority of flavors, are unique and sound interesting but arguably sometimes just taste too weird or downright not yummy. Their limited traditional flavors like chocolate and vanilla are solid. I guess if one is an adventurous type and or bored of the usual flavors, this would be a great place, but those who prefer the standard and or tried and true flavor combos may not find their menu a bit over the top. Luckily, they do allow samples, otherwise it would be difficult and possibly disastrous to commit to an entire serving (which is of course pricey as expected for SF, without trying first.) interior was clean and nice, with 4 stools for seating (there are benches outside as well).

          "Oh man, where do I even start with Salt & Straw? This place is like if a rogue alchemist snuck into a dairy farm and started experimenting with forbidden elixirs. I strolled in with high hopes and emerged victorious with a milkshake that\u2019s basically liquid gold: sea salt caramel as the silky base, crowned with two scoops of their olive oil ice cream. Olive oil in ice cream? It sounds like a madcap plot twist, but it delivers; creamy with a whisper of earthy savoriness that dances with the caramel like old flames rekindling. Each slurp was a symphony of rich, balanced bliss. I felt like I\u2019d unlocked a secret level in the game of desserts.\nBut wait, the drama unfolds: the straw. And hey, \u201cStraw\u201d is literally in their name... talk about irony! This biodegradable bad boy decided to split clean down the middle quicker than a celebrity couple in tabloid headlines. One moment it\u2019s heroically tackling the thick shake; the next, it\u2019s in two pieces, forcing me to improvise like a survivalist in the wilderness. Ended up tilting the cup back like I was toasting the gods. Pro tip: pack a backup straw forged from adamantium, or just lean into the mess.\nEven with the straw\u2019s split-second betrayal, this was an epic win. Salt & Straw, you\u2019re the flavor wizard I didn\u2019t know I needed. 5 stars, no notes, because who needs perfection when you\u2019ve got pure, chaotic joy? \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f",

The typewriters, suitcases, and newspapers provide the perfect decor and the dark lighting give everything a dreamy romantic look. The place is deceptively large but that actually works against it because some of the back seats seem like they have no view of the stage at all.\n\nBartenders are all very friendly and knowledgeable. Tried four different drinks on the menu and each had it's own unique flavor. Some, like the under market, had weird flavor combinations that I felt didn't work well together. My favorite was the Dublin down because I'm a sucker for egg white foam in a cocktail and also the different components of the drink gave it a great depth of flavor. They had a fantastic espresso martini even if it still doesn't beat my personal favorite in SF (Persona on sutter street,btw).\n\nI made reservations based on recommendations from other reviews but they didn't seem necessary for a random Wednesday night. That being said, it seems like a reservation does get you a better seat.\n\nFinally, obviously have to talk about the live music. It's the thing that ties all the different elements of this bar together to form the perfect experience. Nothing else in the world can compare to the vibe of listening to live jazz in a low lit room while sipping on a craft cocktail. It really feels like stepping back in time.",

They also let you play music for free so yeah\u2026 10/10\n\nI would upload more photos but it\u2019s just me and my friends going absolutely bonkers at the bar.",

          "The bartender recommended the lychee martini & the cucumber mint gimlet. Both were absolutely delicious. Music was on point the whole time. I really liked this place! Walked here from the Hilton no problem.",
          "We hosted a corporate event at The Owl Tree, and it was absolutely perfect! Adrianna and the bartending staff were fantastic, making sure our signature cocktails were spot on and our guests were well taken care of. The security team was exceptional, managing our guest list and promptly notifying us of any issues. We also had custom decor, and the Owl Tree team handled all the details with ease, coordinating everything flawlessly so we didn\u2019t have to intervene much. Their dedication to ensuring everything went off without a hitch was truly impressive. Highly recommend The Owl Tree for any event!",
          "I had a fantastic time at The Owl Tree Bar! The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, with its dark-wood decor and comfortable black leather booths. Derrick, the bartender, was incredibly friendly and welcoming. I ended up staying longer just to chat with him. He made an amazing espresso martini that I highly recommend. Such a great spot to relax and enjoy some quality drinks!"

The drinks are phenomenal.  This place has some of the best cocktails at the best prices in the area.  They have high end bourbon on the cheap if that's your thing.  All of the cocktail's are very reasonably priced compared to area bars.  The volume of customers this place sees is due to the high level of craftsmanship, speed of service, and quality you are getting for the price.  Definitely stop by by a cocktail!",

When our number was up, the host came to take our order and we continued to wait at the bar. Then when the table was ready, we got seated and the food came quickly. Unusual, but quite efficient process.\n\nI went there specifically for their prime rib. I would say it was average. The pork belly side order was very good!  Their Long Island Ice tea was quite strong.",
          "High-quality steaks, chicken, and ribs in the little italy section of San Jose. A little different setup. Go in and take a number. Wait for your number to be called and place your order, where they'll take your name. Wait for your name to be called, and you'll be taken back to your seat. From there, the food comes fast. Note: you order from the wall, but it doesn't list everything (e.g. - Mac n' cheese, which is really good). Ribs were great. Sirloin was decent.",

The stuffing is delicious but I don't care for the texture I like mine less wet. The gravy is divine mashed potatoes are real. The guys behind the counter are great and seem to be used to people not knowing what to order because it all looks so good . The bartenders were great and made excellent suggestions.  I have been here multiple times during my visit to San Francisco.  Do not miss out on this joint! Get a filling meal at a reasonable price and make sure you do not skip those house made pickles \ud83d\ude0b . I am not a pickle guy but these were exceptional.

          "I love this joint!! I love the go to the counter and get what you want freshly sliced and delicious \ud83d\ude0b.  I am a sucker for Thanksgiving dinner and this place delivers deliciously. You have to ask for cranberry sauce but I can forgive that. The stuffing is delicious but I don't care for the texture I like mine less wet. The gravy is divine mashed potatoes are real. The guys behind the counter are great and seem to be used to people not knowing what to order because it all looks so good . The bartenders were great and made excellent suggestions.  I have been here multiple times during my visit to San Francisco.  Do not miss out on this joint! Get a filling meal at a reasonable price and make sure you do not skip those house made pickles \ud83d\ude0b . I am not a pickle guy but these were exceptional. The charm of this place oozes old school and a no nonsense way of doing things. If you have read this review thank you. You have been great I have been Mike C!!",

It was a huge order.\n\nThe cheesesteaks were dry and the meat looked like it went through a blender. What I mean there is that it was all very finely chopped which didn't make sense for a sandwich as EVERYTHING fell out as soon as you picked it up.\n\nLastly, everything was quite salty. With BBQ, you should expect a little salt especially if they are using dry rubs.  But...it tasted like someone took a big shaker to the fries and meat because it was too much salt.\n\nThis was our first try with them as they just recently opened and I truly hope someone can be successful in that location. I just don't know that we will eat there again."

The Hinodeya Ramen had a bit of a fishy taste, but not in a bad way. The Spicy Miso Ramen was good too, but I was expecting it to have more of a kick. I did only ask for it to be a level 2 though. Next time, I'll shoot for a 4 or 5. Either way, I didn't think I was going to be able to finish, but I polished off both of these bowls.\n\nThe service was good. They brought our ordered out super fast, were willing to bring us additional cups when asked, and were banding on a drum for when I assume they got a tip.\n\nThe atmosphere was fine. Pretty tiny.

We got there pretty close to closing time, but the staff was super friendly and didn\u2019t rush us at all.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen was absolutely incredible\u2014just like what I had at their Oakland location. The broth was rich, creamy, and full of flavor. A lot of places mess this up and serve something too thin or watered down, but Marufuku nails it. The chashu was perfectly cooked, tender, and packed with flavor. Portions were generous too, which is always a plus.\n\nWe also tried the takoyaki and the shrimp buns, and both were awesome. The takoyaki had that perfect soft-inside, crispy-outside texture, and the shrimp buns were flavorful and satisfying. The karaage was decent, though it felt more like regular fried chicken than classic Japanese-style karaage.\n\nThe space is upstairs in the Kinokuniya building, with a casual vibe and a solid drink menu as well.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing spot for ramen and small bites in the city. Whether you\u2019ve been to their other locations or not, this one\u2019s absolutely worth checking out. Highly recommend!",

We got there pretty close to closing time, but the staff was super friendly and didn\u2019t rush us at all.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen was absolutely incredible\u2014just like what I had at their Oakland location.

            "text": "I asked a fellow reviewer where their favorite ramen shop in the city was, in which they replied Mensho. Sold! Mensho is a chain of ramen bars from Japan.\n\nIt was 10:30pm on a Thursday night, a full 45-minutes prior to closing. I thought for sure there'd be no line. Surprise, surprise, we were greeted with a short line about 10 deep. Haters passed by, obnoxiously saying \"OMG, it's noodles and water!?\" And \"This was the worst place I've ever eaten at!\" Well, you know what? You don't know JACK, f'n top ramen haters!\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe tiny shop sports 3 communal high tops and a low-seat counter for a grand total of about 30 warm bodies. You will wait and you will sit with, amongst, or even in between strangers. While hangrily waiting outside, I was getting annoyed at the patrons inside who were SLOWLY eating their ramen, thinking they were doing it deliberately. Explanation will be revealed below.\n\nMENU:\nRamen, mazesoba & aburasoba (soup-less ramen), rice, beer, sake. I didn't see tsukemen listed.\n\nFOOD:\nTori Paitan\nI've heard of this broth style and was anxious to try it. I added a shoyu ajitama. It's been a while since a bowl of ramen made me moan. Wow to the rich, thick, creamy and searing hot broth. I was expecting it to be white in color but it was tannish/light brown. The noodles were wavy and thick, cooked springy al dente and served piping hot too, YES! Included toppings were kale (which I could do without due to its tough stalk), bamboo, dried burdock shavings, green onion, pork chashu and something I've never had, duck chash that was amazing. Nearing the end of the bowl, you're so full from the broth's richness and thickness, you will slow down. Sorry for talking crap about those inside before me who I thought were table camping, lol. Highly recommended for the ramen connoisseur.\n\nEnoki Mushroom Chips\nYum, like mushroom tempura! The squeeze of lemon and sprinkling of a red spicy-looking salt really weren't needed.\n\nOrganic Shoyu Ramen\nI'm a shoyu broth fanatic so this was a must-try. The broth had a strong smoky-bonito flavor which I loved. Unfortunately they ran out of both miso & shoyu ajitamas 2 hours after opening, but I did get added bean sprouts and the included pork and duck chashu, bamboo, nori square and yucky kale, though the kale sprouts were good. The noodles in this version were flat and wide, still cooked perfectly chewy and came out searing hot. This ranks right up there for me with the version at Momofuku.\n\nSpicy Lamb Ramen\nIf you think the Tori Paitan is thick and rich, this sucker is beats it. It's a miso broth topped with ground lamb, pork chashu, nira (Chinese leeks) bamboo and green onions. No egg for my spouse either as they ran out, but he did receive burdock shavings. The spoonful of broth I tasted was intense and a bit like curry. Personally, I'd stick to the paitan for a rich broth, but he absolutely loved it.\n\nSERVICE:\nNo reservations are made. We were seated in about 35 minutes. The staff were friendly and professional, and food service was quick. The only hiccup was the absence of a requested glass of water.\n\nTIPS:\nThe menu posted at the sidewalk entry is less detailed than the menu given at the table (some ramen styles and toppings weren't listed).\n\nThere's an automatic 15% gratuity to all parties, something I despise. What a shame because I would've left 20%.\n\nOVERALL:\nWas it worth the wait? Absolutely.",

The open restaurant is a cool concept and always fun to see.\n\nThe restaurant has a QR code that allows you to pay and take orders through their online app. It makes it convenient and helps with the flow of the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the popular items - Spicy Tan Tan, Soy Sauce Ramen and their half and half fries.\n\nSpicy Tan Tan had just enough kick to feel a burn but not enough to overpower. Very flavorful and rich. Highly recommend this dish.\n\nSoy Sauce Ramen felt lighter and had a more herbal taste which is great for those who want a lighter meal for the night.\n\nHalf and Half fries are a must try. The truffle oil is incredible.\n\nLoved this restaurant. It felt very exciting being inside with it being so lively.",
