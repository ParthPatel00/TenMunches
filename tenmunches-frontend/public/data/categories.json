          "I love this spot! It’s a cozy little space, but perfect for grabbing a coffee and pastry on the go. The folks working here are always so chipper and friendly; the pastry selection is phenomenal. The ube croissant is unique and delicious. Their cappuccinos are always perfectly crafted.",
          "Great coffee and amazing service! The espresso was delicious, and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I really enjoyed my visit and highly recommend this place. I’ll definitely be back again ☕️",
          "Cute, clean, and bright coffee shop with owners who really care. I went today and both owners were working. They have a large pastry selection, with traditional “fika” Swedish buns from Thursday to Sundays. They’re phenomenal, I’ve only tried the cinnamon fika bun but I’ll be trying the others as well. I believe they use Sightglass coffee, both the flat white and dirty chai I got tasted great. The chai wasn’t too sweet.\n\nThis spot is also great because lots of dogs are regulars here! So you always get fluffy friends inside. It also seems like there’s tons of regulars, as I often hear the owners saying “So, the usual ___ (insert name of customer)?” I may become one of those regulars even though I live in Outer Richmond, I like this place so much!\n\nAdded bonus: really clean bathrooms, lots of windows for bright environment, kind, prompt service, owners who genuinely care about their establishment. Only con (although not a terrible one) very limited seating! Maybe only for 8-10 people. But they do well considering the size. All in all, 5 stars and possibly my new favorite coffee spot at the moment!"

          "Terrific third wave, stopped here on the way to cheering the SF half marathon. I love that they do the 3 way tasting, with a coffee prepared 3 ways, I had a very floral coffee. Pastries are good too.",
          "Here’s a polished and natural rewrite of your review:\n\n---\n\nA nice coffee shop in the Richmond District. It’s usually busy, and the space isn’t very large, though there is some seating available. What they’re best known for, as far as I know, is the tasting flight — three featured coffees of the day served either as different pours or prepared in different ways. They also offer several types of coffee beans.\n\nThere are three workers behind the counter preparing drinks, and they work very efficiently. Orders come out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the tasting flight, a cocoa cappuccino, a latte, and some pastries. I really enjoyed the tasting flight — it’s a unique way to sample three different coffees or brewing styles. It was a great experience. We usually stop by whenever we’re in the area. The prices are reasonable and affordable. I also really like their espresso machine. ☕\nParking is on the street and could be challenging near the shop.",
          "The chai latte is well-spiced and creamy—easily one of the better ones around. Espresso drinks are good too, made with quality beans, and the espresso tonic is nicely balanced with lime/orange twist. Friendly spot with decent pastries and outdoor seating. Worth checking out. Close to golden gate park and de young museum."

          "Delah Coffee is such a gem in San Francisco, tucked away near 4th St and Clara St. I heard this was one of the first coffee shops to come to the SF area, and it definitely feels special the moment you walk in. The interior is absolutely beautiful with really nice furniture and a warm, inviting vibe.\nThe service was excellent—super friendly and attentive. I ordered the chai along with a borak (cheese pastry), and everything was delicious. The cheese pastry came with honey, which was the perfect touch.\nThey have a great menu with classics like meat pies, cheesecakes, milk cakes, and a nice variety of refreshers as well. Whether you’re stopping by for coffee, dessert, or a light bite, this place hits the spot. Definitely worth a visit!",
          "Delay Coffee is such a cozy and refreshing spot! Their pistachio latte is absolutely delicious — creamy, perfectly sweet, and full of real pistachio flavor. The tea is smooth and comforting, and they offer an amazing variety of snacks and desserts that taste as good as they look. Everything feels fresh and handmade.\n\nIt’s the perfect place to relax, grab a warm drink, and enjoy some treats. Highly recommended if you want something yummy and comforting!",
          "Wonderful atmosphere, delicious, strong coffee, expertly created, lovely service... The staff is a riot 😂 they always make me laugh or have something to say.. especially the manager, I dont know her name but she always has such a great attitude and makes me feel better. I come in here all the time to order the Rose Latte, and work on some stuff on my laptop.. great to bring a friend"

          "Visited The Coffee Movement yesterday. It’s a very small spot with no indoor seating or restroom—just an outdoor standing area and a small bench. I ordered an anericano which is roasted at Sint Frank Coffee as their house blend, and it was incredibly smooth and delicious. They offer oat milk only as non dairy option. The only downside was that I wish the coffee had been a bit hotter. That said, the staff were absolutely wonderful—so kind and welcoming. If I’m ever in the area again, I’d definitely stop by.\n\nCC accepted",
          "The Coffee Movement in San Francisco is such a gem. The coffee is the perfect blend — not too sweet, not too bitter, just incredibly smooth. I got the ginger latte and it tasted amazing. They were also able to accommodate dietary restrictions and made mine with almond milk, which I really appreciated.\n\nMy partner got a cappuccino with a sprinkle of chocolate on top, and it was really nice as well. Cozy spot, great service, and genuinely delicious drinks. Highly recommend stopping by!also there not a lot of indoor seating spot so if you’re cold dress warm you seat outside",
          "The Coffee Movement in Chinatown is such a gem. It’s a tiny spot but the baristas make every drink with so much care, and you can really taste the difference. I tried their latte and it was smooth, rich, and beautifully balanced. The vibe is friendly and relaxed, with outdoor seating that makes it a nice place to hang out for a bit. It feels more like an experience than just grabbing a quick coffee. Definitely one of the best stops in SF for coffee lovers."

And here, at third wheel coffee, we found exactly that. I ordered a flat white, and thoroughly enjoyed it. My wife's vanilla latte was also amazing, and so was the pastry that we had. (We also ordered a matcha for the road which was quite good as well.) The shop is located in a cool urban San Francisco location. The barista was kind and friendly, as well as very knowledgeable. You can tell coffee is his passion! Would definitely recommend going out of your way for if you're in the San Francisco area!"

          "I got hooked on Yemeni coffee beans while traveling in Egypt, and HEYMA Coffee absolutely nails that flavor profile. The coffee is rich, deep, and aromatic, clearly treated with care, not rushed or over-roasted.\n\nIf you’re into proper coffee, this will hit. It reminds me of traditional Turkish-style coffee, especially that warm, subtly sweet spice note (cardamom) that adds depth without overpowering the beans.\n\nThe rose milk cake has strong dulce de leche energy: soft, milky, lightly floral, finished with pistachios. It’s indulgent but balanced, and it pairs beautifully with the coffee.\n\nGreat atmosphere, thoughtful menu, and it’s located right by Civic Center BART and well connected to the rest of downtown. Definitely worth checking out."

          "Had some tasty lattes here. They have good seasonal flavors during the fall months. I really enjoyed their coffee cups for dine in drinks.",
          "One of the best third wave coffees in the Bay Area, a consistent excellent medium roast espresso, as well as an interesting selection of pastries. The space is industrial chic, with the roasting machines in the back of the space. Not too busy in the early morning",
          "I went here on a Friday morning. The place was busy and packed. The coffeeshop is spacious. There were ppl talking or people on their laptops.\n\nThey only serve coffee, meaning no specialty flavored drinks. My friend ordered our drinks while I saved our seats. The service seems great and the place is pretty big. You can see the staff roasting the beans in the back. My latte was good. I ordered oat milk but it tasted like either 1% milk or non fat milk. Luckily, I wasn’t allergic to dairy so I didn’t bother to bring it up to the staff. Also, I normally get flavored drinks but the latte was good. I would go back"

          "Tuesday at 10:15am.\nThe café was quite full of patrons drinking coffee and eating the $14 avocado toast.\nI ordered a matcha latte with oat milk to go. ~$8!!!! The taste was mild, not very strong.\nThis NoPA neighborhood is well suited for well- and highly-paid tech workers. Not reasonably priced beverage or food. The patrons mostly had their laptops open and doing work. They were parked out and taking over space for people who just want to chill with a coffee or tea. This café needs a No laptops policy.",
          "Stopped by The Mill and everything was a hit.\n\nThe cortado was perfect — smooth, balanced, and just the right size.\n\nFood-wise:\n•\tThe Egg in the Hole was the standout — that garlic butter on the country bread is next-level.\n•\tThe smoked trout toast came in a close second, fresh and flavorful.\n•\tThe hummus + cauliflower toast was good, just not as memorable as the others.\n\nWrapped it all up with a slice of the persimmon cinnamon pistachio crumble cake, which was absolutely outstanding — warm, spiced, and perfectly textured.\n\nGreat vibe, friendly staff, and beautifully executed menu. Will definitely be back."

My iced coffee was particularly satisfying, and they made it with non-dairy milk which was a win for me. The almond croissant was great, tasty filling and nice crispy edges. Highly recommend!",

I am sad about the many mornings I will freeze in line to get this...\n\nFor the snobs: Yes, you'll find coffee and beans that are comparable in many places in sf (we're privileged like that, aren't we?).\n\nThis place is not a coffee shop, though. It's a coffee experience. All credits to the team. You get to know and discuss your coffee with knowledgeable and kind staff.\n\nI will see y'all soon :)"

Special consideration also given to presentation.\n\nService is only via counter and self service tabling.\n\nCafe decor is also contemporary and a hybrid of modern Western styles mixed with slight Middle Eastern touches\n\nThe place is commonly frequented by remote workers and seating can get pretty limited",

We had so much pizza leftover and it was good value\n\nBad:\n- The place was a bit dim\n- Detroit pizza was smaller for the price\n\nOverall this was so much fun and loved the pizza it was quite tasty"

          "The pizza here is amazing. I tried the pepperoni slice and it was genuinely delicious with a very authentic flavor. Even late at night the queue was surprisingly long, which says a lot about how popular the place is.\n\nIt’s just a small takeaway counter, so don’t expect a premium atmosphere, more of a classic, local vibe. During peak hours you’ll need to wait in line, and once you reach the front you place your order, pay, and give your name. After that there’s a short wait until they call you, and then you get your pizza.\n\nOverall, great taste and totally worth the wait if you’re craving a quality slice.",

          "The pizza here was good — not amazing, but definitely enjoyable. To be fair, I’m from Berlin where there are a lot of excellent pizza places, so my standards might be a bit high. Compared to what I’m used to, this wasn’t better, but it was still a solid choice if you’re in the area and craving Italian food.\n\nI had the Montepulciano wine, which was very good. I sat outside, and they had heaters, so it was comfortable even in cooler weather. The staff was very friendly as well.\n\nOverall, a solid option for a casual Italian meal.",
          "This is one of my go-to spots in San Francisco. I’ve probably been here 20 times or more. There’s so much good pizza in North Beach, but this one really feels authentic. I usually get their marinara though their pasta is also excellent. I especially love the pesto pasta. The restaurant has cute outdoor seating, and while they don’t take reservations, I usually find a spot easily. It’s perfect for big groups or a romantic date night. For me, this is a reliable, safe bet that’s always a great experience."

          "Great pizza! A very solid option in the city for a New York style slice. Very thin crust which is more crackery, which is not my preference, but executed well. Good char on the crust, but a bit too much mozzarella in my opinion. The thicker layer of cheese doesn’t reheat fully and is slightly chewy. Sauced down mildly. All nitpicks, good slice, 8.7",
          "For a super cheap pizza, this place is pleasantly surprising - they have daily specials and unexpected add ons like anchovies or stracciatella. I tried the ruby (their vodka sauce) and a Vinny's special (onions, chives and creme fraiche). Both were ok in flavor (especially considering the price). I was a little concerned that a dog was allowed to sit at one of the tables, didn't feel very sanitary..."

          "A real blast from the past - used to go here with our small kids in the early 2000s. Still just as cute. Pizzertas are still just as delicious (if not quite as quirky as they used to be - though maybe that is a good thing for the business?). Well worth a visit",
          "Simply delicious and fantastic service with cozy, warm setting.  I was looking for a simple, thin crust neighborhood type place in SF and saw this so giving a try.  It blown my mind with everything from the great chill relax vibe, to great nice and friendly service and the foods are simple but yet elevated to several unexpected levels.  Our server recommended the farm egg pizza and I picked the pepperoni one.  I was skeptical at first of the farm egg but surprisingly I like it more than my pepperoni (still fantastic but damn).  Who knows that eggs pizza was that fantastic and so yum!  The salad is simple but tasty and the dressing was marinated well without seeing it, just tasting.  We finished it all without stopping.  We just ate 4hrs prior so we’re are still full (just want a good pizza before we flying the next day) but the pizzas and the salad was just somehow disappeared without us knowing that we ate them all. On top of these, we ordered the passion fruit panna cotta and yup, gone just gone within 2mins.  Really want to order more but had to restrain or else we’re unable to fit into our clothes. Will be on my list to must comeback in SF for sure.  Thank you for the incredible foods and service. Just simply loving it. Oh they have inside but it’s small and tight with 6-7 table for 2-4 seatings, but they do have outdoor sitting with heat lamps and blankets.  Very romantic and cozy place for sure.",
          "This was a really very good place. The pizzettas were fresh and made with high quality ingredients. We tried the hazelnut pizza and it was very delicious and interesting. They also offer homemade sausages, and the salads were creative and something different. The service was great. The place itself is quite tiny and small, but cozy."

Wildly interesting eclectic decor, especially the washroom.  The neighbourhood is a little more gritty but not dangerous by my accounts, and there are neighbourhood ambassadors around as well.",
          "We absolutely loved dining here! The pesto and the eggplant with red pepper pinsas were outstanding, and the cauliflower salad appetizer was bursting with flavor. The atmosphere has a charming vintage feel that makes the place so inviting, and the staff’s kindness made the experience even better. Can’t wait to visit again!",
          "Super tasty Roman-style pizza (with a great selection of antipasti too) served in a cozy, gorgeous space. I stopped by Montesacro SoMa with a friend for a weekend dinner after receiving multiple recommendations for this spot from several coworkers / friends. I got there a few minutes early, so I was immediately struck by how cozy and intimate the store felt; the staff seemed relaxed but on top of their game, and I loved that you could somewhat (but not quite...to preserve the mystery of it all) see the kitchen work their magic with a partially visible container of prepared dough, slightly exposed assembly counter. I love the walls of wine bottles, random chandeliers, and deli counter -- it genuinely felt like I was back in Rome.\n\nFor food, we started with the Sottoli, a plate of beautifully EVOO-marinated vegetables (red bell peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and eggplant), topped with a bit of chili and parsley. I loved the simplicity of this antipasti; the veggies were super flavorful and delicious. It's a great vegetarian or gluten-free choice, but you can also get an order of their bread if you'd like to bulk up this appetizer. The veggies were delicious on their own, but also went wonderfully with the main star of the show, the pizza. We got their margherita just so we could compare this classic vs. other pizza joints, and they certainly did not disappoint. The tomato sauce was flavorful, with just the right mix of herbaceous, savory, acidic, and sweet, and the pizza was topped with a generous portion of melty mozzarella and basil. I love that they fully lean into the Roman-ness of their restaurant by serving the more ovular pinsa, with a slightly thicker, chewier crust and highlighting local Roman ingredients. Now that I've confirmed their margherita pizza (or, rather, pinsa) is 10/10, I can't wait to go back and try their other options!"

The crust is perfectly cooked — crispy on the outside and soft inside — and the ingredients are high quality and flavorful. The atmosphere feels lively but still comfortable, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable when helping you pick a pizza. Whether you’re a classic margherita fan or want to try something unique, Tony’s always delivers an amazing pizza experience. 🍕",
          "When I say this was the best Margherita ive ever had. I'm not even exaggerating.  The sauce was so delicious.  We had to try the royal Margherita as well. It came with a fresh basil plant and oil to put on. It's not as big as the Margherita but packs a punch. We can't wait to come back to the bay and eat here again. I highly recommend this place. Service was good even though busy. Prices were reasonable as well. Especially when its so delicious.  Thank you for such a great meal.",
          "Man, I miss SF. The best city in the world. Walking through North Beach brought back so many memories and is even more magical that what I remember. A lot of San Francisco's charm is the array of restaurants and the neighborhoods they are in.\n\nJust look at the picture...\n\nTony's pizza does not need my review, obviously. They have a firmly planted existence here and they are wholeheartedly deserving of all the praise and stellar reviews on their legendary pizza.\n\nMy review is for all the professional servers. They were very attentive and efficient. Casual observation showed they all worked together seamlessly and enmeshed into the vibe of this buzzing room belonging to the most pleasing pizza.\n\nMuch props to the Tony's team for an excellent experience!"

They also served us an outstanding tiramisù - the best tiramisù we had in the city. The waiter was also very nice, and the place is very quiet. Couldn't recommend it enough!!",

          "We really loved this pizza place because the pizza was delicious and so was the dough. It was hot and very fresh and you could tell that it was homemade. I highly recommend this amazing pizza.",
          "HALAL rest\nAmbiance - Low\nPrice - Low\nWorking hours - Open late night, solid to have late night snack\nStaff - Mr. Mukhtar (owner) is very welcoming and humble person. Every staff is very kind and sweet.\nService - Excellent\n\nFood:\nChicken pizza - fair\nMeat pizza - excellent 😍\n\nHighly recommend - to have halal pizza & late night options in the city.",
          "The pizza at this location is, frankly, underwhelming, especially if you’ve experienced higher-quality pizza elsewhere. A single slice ranges around $6.40, depending on the variety, but the quality doesn’t justify the price. This is the type of pizza one might reach for late at night, perhaps after a night out, when taste isn’t a primary concern.\n\nWhen fully sober, the pizza’s flavor reveals an unpleasant chemical undertone that’s difficult to overlook. It’s simply not enjoyable for those seeking a satisfying, well-crafted slice.\n\nFor a genuinely better experience, I recommend Out of Sight Pizza, just a block or two away. Their pizza is more affordable, higher quality, served with excellent customer service, and enjoyed in a clean, welcoming atmosphere. That said, this location serves as a convenient option for late-night cravings when other choices are limited."

(A little dry, actually.)\n\nThat said, the clam chowder was excellent, and the milk shake was amazing!! Can’t remember the last time I I was served a shake with the tin canister. I’d go back just for that!\n\nIn fact, the I’d go back anyway. Just maybe just not looking for the burger apocalypse!",

We had the Aussie burger and the cheeseburger. Come with an appetite as the burgers are big and the fries are great."

          "Was very hungry after a +50k steps day around SF and craving for a proper large burger not too far from my hotel.\nLucky me, Pearl’s was just around the corner and following some online reviews I went for the Deluxe Bula Burger with extra mushroom and Kobe meat as replacement (buffalo not being available unfortunately) with a side of a mix French fries and onion rings.\nSaid sides were absolutely perfect, best French fries I had for quite a moment and onion rings crispy without being too dry.\nBurger was massive and really comforting. Not the the absolute best I have ever had but very decent with a meat cooked to my desire (real “rare”).\nAtmosphere was low key and very quiet, with fellow European travelers from Italy and France dining there too.\nAll in all a great no-frills comforting experience after a long and busy day with the best possible food to indulge in.",
          "We went late (10 pm on a Friday). The burgers were fresh and fast.  They were juicy and incredible.  I had the Phat bob, she had the mushroom.  They were amazing.  The garlic fries are also great, made with fresh garlic.  The onion rings were ok but def go for the fries instead.  Service was fast, helpful, and friendly.  A great experience."

Line might be long but orders come out decently fast except when someone in front of you is ordering for their whole friend group... Some outdoor seating but that's it so I recommend coming with a car to eat in or a warm jacket. The parking lot is small and usually pretty crowded and street parking nearby might not be the easiest for non locals.\n\nFries are great. Burgers are great too. All Made with peanut oil apparently though :(",

You could order at the counter or on the kiosk. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They provide extra Condiments like mustard, ketchup and pickles on its own side station. There is seating inside and a patio outside. Best thing to do is to sit in the window and people watch. Excellent spot, really good vibes! A MUST TRY",

While seating is compact, it’s thoughtfully arranged to maximize comfort and flow. The branding is clear and cohesive without feeling forced or overdone. The restaurant prioritizes efficiency while maintaining a welcoming atmosphere. Overall, this location succeeds as a reliable, well-designed spot for quality burgers in San Francisco."

          "Good quality burgers with reasonable wait times. Milk shakes were ok. Our garlic fries were an oily soggy mess. No table service, self-service sodas and free pickles. Seating is ok but not very comfortable, also the music is loud inside making it hard to have a conversation .",
          "The best Super Duper location for burgers. The burgers are consistently juicier here. They actually will cook your burger to medium-rare when requested. Other locations seem to think medium is medium-rare. Nope. I've probably eaten at Super Duper at least 50 times, and the Castro location 30 times.\n\nPlus the people watching of the sidewalk and intersection from the south facing counter stools is outstanding!",
          "I been here during late night when I was craving for a burger while I was very hungry. Upon arrival, there was a bit of a line, but I did not mind it since I needed some time to decide what to get since it was my first time here in general. Finally it was my turn to order and I was met with one of their welcoming, well trained and understanding staffs that made the process a quick and easy one. I decided to order to go since my friend was waiting in the car where parking was not the best option in the area due to the overall safety. Everything was made to order which is the way I like it and I never mind the wait since I am a very patient person. Luckily I still captured a photo of my order even though I conquered my burger in a minute or two due to hunger. I highly recommend this place to all burger enthusiasts, if you are looking to try something new or in need of a quick bite just like me. I definitely will be back to tryout the other delicious options they have to offer."

          "It was my first time trying their double meltburger, and it was really delicious! The beef patties were juicy and huge, I couldn't even finish them in one sitting, and ended up splitting them into three meals lol. Highly recommended!",
          "After a lackluster meal at Mel's the night before, I decided to search for a top rated location this time. I came across The Melt which was heavily favored and rightfully so.\n\nAlthough the location was busy, I was able to walk right up and use one of the self service kiosks to place my order. The interface was easy and helpful. I ordered a double BBQ Bacon Meltburger and a Cookies and Cream shake. Within a few minutes my order was ready and it looked great. This burger was huge, and since it cost 18 bucks, it better be! I could barely bite into this burger it was so massive. It was fantastic, so much flavor and quality meat. The shake was equally as great and helped wash down this tasty burger. The food was a little pricey, but you definitely get your money's worth. This is the perfect spot for a lunch or late night grub. Would definitely revisit if I had the chance because some of the other meals look just as good.",
          "Stopped in for a quick lunch bite to go. This is a casual sandwich shop. Very minimal decor. White walls, concrete floor and a few tables and chairs. You could enter your order at the kiosk or directly with the cashier. I Ordered a tomato soup which was smooth and creamy and tasty. I also ordered the Italian Job which is a mushroom and cheese sandwich on a spicy garlic bread. Unfortunately the bread wasn't spicy nor garlic. I'd stop by again for the soup alone."

          "recently visited Super Duper Burgers and overall had a good experience. The burgers are fresh, well-prepared, and you can really taste the quality of the ingredients, especially the beef and buns. I liked that the menu is simple and focused, which makes it easy to choose without feeling overwhelmed. The fries were crispy and paired well with the burger, and the sauces added great flavor.\n\nThat said, the experience wasn’t perfect. During busy hours, the waiting time can be a bit long, and seating may feel crowded. Prices are slightly on the higher side compared to regular burger places, so it feels more like an occasional treat than an everyday stop. Staff were generally friendly, though service speed could improve during peak times.\n\nOverall, Super Duper Burgers offers tasty, high-quality burgers with room for improvement in service efficiency. I’d recommend it if you enjoy fresh burgers and don’t mind waiting a little.",
          "It was ok.\nI had booked marked this place because they have veggie burgers, I was hoping black bean burgers type of veggie.\nThey only had 1 type of chicken burger.  Overall this place was not what I was expecting or my cup of tea. As a ranch conuseur the ranch in this place was the only good thing.",
          "I ordered the super burger with sharp cheddar. The flavor was really nice. The meat has a nice crisp crust and was super juicy.\nEverything was nicely balanced.\nIn the future I'll do the mini because the super had so much meat.\n\nThe garlic fries had a really nice flavor as well.\n\nWe ended with a soft serve cone we shared with our son. It was a nice surprise.\n\nService was good and the staff were friendly."

          "All vegan Japanese restaurant that has celiac-safe GF options - wow! Super excited to try this place so when I was in the area at 4:15 last Sunday, having missed lunch, thought I’d stop by. Was surprised to see there were already people waiting for it to open and the line was quite long when it opened at 4:30. Reservations are recommended but we were lucky enough to be accommodated. A charming dining area, albeit not a ton of elbow room. Seating options include tables up to four, up to two, and a small sushi bar.\n\nThe waitstaff were very friendly and responsive and helpful with recommendations.\n\nFood wise, everything was good, including the miso soup and yuba salad, but the rolls are where the magic is. They’re all beautifully crafted and presented. We tried the California roll (great!), sweet tofu nigiri, Missing piece (made GF), and Boddy and Soul (recommended, and a winner by my dining partner, but not GF).\n\nIt was a real delight to enjoy such delicious food, carefully created, crafted, and presented, making it a multi sensory treat.\n\nWish there was a GF tempura option to make more of the rolls available to celiacs, but I loved what I had. Definitely recommend the fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere and uniquely Japanese vibe. Think stylish onsen, an indulgence where you leave feeling fulfilled, healthy, and happy!",
          "Delicious vegan sushi that actually delivers on flavor! The Dynamite Roll (10/10) was the highlight, followed closely by the Roasted Bell Pepper Nigiri (9/10). The Shishito Peppers and Candlestick roll were also solid (8/10).\n\nThe price point feels high given the portion sizes, but the technique is impressive and it gives vegans a genuine sushi experience. Highly recommended for the execution, especially if you don't eat fish."

          "Been a rough week and The Bite made sure I end it on a high note. I just ordered late night delivery for tonight's dinner, and next two days of meals. Entrées are high quality ingredients. Made fresh to order. Meat was not dried out. Lightly seasoned to enjoy the fresh natural flavor of the foods.\n\nBonus points for the careful packaging of my delivery order, especially the protective wrapping for the soups.\n\nHighly recommend!!!"

          "I ordered the mushroom pizza and let me tell you it was soooooo delicious. Just a side note I would advise adding on a sauce and warming up your slices if you get it delivered because it soooo yummy. This ended up being 2 meals for me as it was quite filling (but in a good way)",
          "The brunch dishes are delicious with lots of good drink options both alcoholic and non alcoholic. I would love even more brunch options! Dinner options are ok.",
          "I love this restaurant! My friends treated me there for nice dinner after their engagement photoshoot. I’m not a vegan person but I must say, I’m super impressed.\nWe ordered the Italian sausage pizza because I was curious to know how close a plant based sausage could be to the real thing. Surprisingly, it was very close and delicious, but definitely didn’t taste artificial or processed! The pizza crust was crunchy, moderate thin (and with good texture) and doughy, and I love it. I they did a great job to let the customers know what ingredients were used (both through the menu and verbal), the service was excellent and the staff cared deeply if the customer had any food allergies.\nWhat truly impressed me was my main course, the Thai curry. It is the most flavourful Thai curry I have ever had these days, and it was served black rice. I love how healthy it is and yet it is even better than meat-flavored curry.\nWill definitely come back again to try more vegan food there."

          "Service was friendly and helpful. The inside is clean, spacious, and well decorated. Menu is entirely vegan. Food is amazing and the cost is phenomenal. Portions sizes are good. I ordered more than I normally would, but I spent several hours walking around San Francisco and was pretty hungry.",
          "Golden Era is a rare find in the plant-based dining scene. While too many vegan establishments focus on ethical and environmental benefits but serve what is essentially non-meat junk food, this restaurant takes a different approach. The food here is not only good for the planet and the animals but is also good for your health.\n\nThe extensive menu encompasses Vietnamese and Chinese specialties that can be customized to meet specific dietary needs. The service was caring and family-like, filled with helpful advice. When we requested adjustments to our dishes, they were executed perfectly. Furthermore, when we mentioned that one of our party is a fan of spicy food, the staff responded not with a single option, but with three different sources of heat—a gesture that was highly appreciated and added significant enjoyment to the meal.\n\nThe cuisine is excellent and the service is commendable, but we must point out one significant weakness: the restroom. Unfortunately, we found the entire mirror covered with rude inscriptions. For a family-friendly establishment, this is out of place, and the management would do well to clean it up promptly.\n\nAs ordinary consumers, we are not paid or compensated in any way for this review. We appreciate the healthy, high-quality food and hope the facility maintenance matches the kitchen's standards in the future.",
          "Oh my! My favorite spot when I'm in SF. The best Asian Fusion Restaurant I've had. The Spicy Sweet Potato Curry and Quinoa Salad dishes were mouth watering. Great spices on the curry dish. The salad is out of this world.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Mango sticky rice. I was hooked. I wanted seconds.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu. Reasonable prices. Great service. A few blocks away from City Hall. Parking is sometimes hard to find."

          "such a cute place wit a good amount of vegan options! started off with the garlic butter parm brussel sprouts and the sweet potato! both were sooo yum (even better when combined lol). for the mains, I got the eggplant thing which was … interesting. the eggplant itself was crispy and crunchy but the soup/wtew it was on was … not my fav lol. interesting flavors kinda reminded me of goulash! wish it was a little more seasoned and hot, but overall pretty good experience and i would go again! also the sweetest and friendliest server helped us and 10/10 for service and ambiance!",
          "Goddamn this place is a gem. If you’re gluten-free, Firefly will become your favourite restaurant in the city. If you’re gluten-full, I reckon it still will too :)\n\nFor starters, the atmosphere here is very warm and cozy. Perfect for a fall evening. The art and eccentric ornaments/details don’t go unnoticed. I really appreciate how this doesn’t just feel like a restaurant — it’s almost like an extension of your own home (just with awe-striking gluten-free food.)\n\nWhich brings me to… the gluten-free food.\n\nFried chicken?! I mean… how?! This was my first fried chicken ever, and it did not disappoint. It also exceeded my boyfriend’s expectations (who loves the gluten) — so you know it’s good.\n\nThe squash dish was exceptional — so too were the sweet potatoes.\n\nBut the cherry on top of it all was the brownie with cornflakes and vanilla ice custard… I haven’t stopped thinking about it ever since.\n\nIt’s a 99.9% gluten free menu, asides from 1 side of bread which can be swapped for cornbread (if I’m recalling correctly) so BASICALLY it’s HEAVEN ON EARTH"

Even the ketchup is ridiculously good.\n\nWhen I first started coming here they were never too packed inside. Now if I come 11am or a little after lunch almost every table is full. Wish they had more locations.",
          "I had dinner at Rad Radish yesterday and was thoroughly impressed by this 100% plant-based gem in Hayes Valley. The restaurant immediately catches your eye with its vibrant, colorful signage and welcoming storefront that perfectly captures the energy of the neighborhood. I ordered the Impossible Burger with avocado and fries, and it absolutely delivered. The burger was expertly prepared with a great balance of flavors and textures - the Impossible patty was juicy and satisfying, complemented perfectly by fresh avocado and crisp lettuce on a sesame seed bun. The fries were golden and crispy, served alongside a delicious ketchup that tied the meal together beautifully. What really sets Rad Radish apart is the atmosphere. The space is stunning with its modern industrial design, featuring exposed ceilings, warm wood floors, and an abundance of lush greenery throughout. The hanging plants and natural elements create such a fresh, inviting environment that makes you want to linger. The lighting is perfect for both casual dining and catching up with friends.\nThe restaurant strikes that perfect balance of being trendy yet comfortable, with a layout that feels both spacious and intimate. It’s clear they’ve put thought into creating a space that’s as beautiful as their food is delicious. Rad Radish proves that plant-based dining can be both satisfying and stylish. I’ll definitely be back to explore more of their menu - this place is a real winner in the Hayes Valley dining scene!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​"

          "amazing experience, love that it’s 100% plant based and cruelty free! great vibes and service. amazing mushroom skewers tasted like the grill and looked like chicken. Would def come back. strong drinks!!!",
          "Delicious vegan food! Some were a little too sweet, too burned, but otherwise, it was such a hearty meal. Staff are friendly. Walk-in is fine for lunch. A reservation is recommended for dinner. It’s challenging to find street parking.",
          "Where to start with the experience at aiso... Well easy meso happy I gave this place a try.  With no expectations and in company of good friends I was just happy to try a new place and hopefully one that could lift the average food experience in the Castro.\nWell they didn't disappoint, pretty much every dish but one is a thumbs up.\nLoved the beet tartare, the sliders, the yucca and the udon. Not so much the pesto rigatoni.  The rigatoni felt a bit on the dry side and the pesto overpowering.\nThe sliders were super balanced in texture and flavor and the beet salad was a pure joy , the cucumber just the right crunch and the beet adding that slight sweet and citrus flavor, beautiful.\nThe service was lovely and attentive.  I wish the restaurant owner would invest into a new door closer, the current one stops short and leaves the door open and the front of the restaurant a bit in the cold side.  Luckily our waiter added the frequent closing of the door to her duties .\nGreat experience, doesn't matter if your vegan vegetarian or love your meat, the dishes will appeal to your taste buds."

          "Of course the croissants are absolutely mind-blowing, but can we talk about the CCC? This has been elevated to my favorite chocolate chip cookie in SF (my previous #1 was Batter). The outer edges are ultra chewy and caramelized, while the inside is chewy, and there is a layer of bittersweet chocolate of the highest quality through the center. Truly perfection.\n\nI tried the chocolate croissant and it’s an absolutely massive pillowy layered and buttery dream. The bittersweet chocolate inside was still a bit melted. I would share it unless you’re very hungry—it’s super large!\n\nI went on a Wednesday morning around 9 AM and the line was about 6 deep but moved very quickly. I would happily wait longer and it would still be worth it!"

          "Came here for the review and it was indeed a decent bakery, but perhaps not quite what it’s hyped up to be.\n\nWe got a chocolate croissant, a regular butter croissant, a chocolate kouign amann, and a lemon tart. The croissants are pretty standard — a bit dry, not too buttery (compared to other splendid bakeries in SF like Arsicault). The chocolate croissant doesn’t have a whole lot of chocolate in it. The kouign amann, on the other hand, was really good. It’s flaky and the chocolate is rich. The lemon tart was pretty nice too, but it’s about $8, which I don’t think is worth the price, either.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience. The staff were nice and helpful, the toilet was clean, and it wasn’t too crowded by the time we got there (around 11:00, no lines at all). But personally, I don’t think the pastry is what it’s cracked up to be.",
          "Cute patisserie, the coffe is good the pastries wonderful. Rich flavors. Seating is tight. There was a lin to get in. The parking is difficult in the area but that the norm. Service was great and helpful. We would go back when we in town. The sign out front was a little hard to see to find the store. Cute place",
          "Some of the best pastries I’ve had.\n\nImpossible to pick a favorite and wish I was able to try more. I had the Koign aman, a chocolate pastry, and a chocolate banana croissant. The croissant was one of the best I’ve ever had with the inside a warm gooey chocolate chip banana bread and the outside still crispy and buttery.\n\nThe koign amans (probably misspelled) were amazing too, I was able to try the classic as well as the seasonal apple pear and those felt like a huge upgrade to a regular croissant for me.\n\nThe chocolate one I had was more dessert than breakfast but I’ll remember that one for certain as it was fantastic."

Try the ridiculous pear + cherry seasonal scone of the day or the Triple Mushroom Sour Dough Pizza with sesame, ginger garlic vinaigrette.\nThey serve TWO King Cakes for the Epiphany.\nGalette des Rois, a puff pastry filled with a rich almond filling AND Rosca de Reyes, a brioche dough with a hint of orange filled with a sweet molasses and pecan filling, decorated cream cheese topping and dried fruit......5 Stars is truly not enough -JD"

          "Amazing store for Russian Food. We ordered the borscht, pelmeni, olivye, and medovik. It did take a bit for our main dishes to come out but its a family run restaurant so i was a-ok waiting. We had a tub of olivye and slice of medovik to snack on anyways so all good.\n\nThe olivye was quite salty but i do tend to like my food quite salty so it was very tasty to me. The medovik or honey cake was the highlight of the meal, not too sweet, super soft and filled with pieces of what seem to be walnuts and sour cream frosting that had a great tang (what i think is often missing from american cream cheese frosting)\n\nthe borscht was earthy and comforting and also vegetarian just fyi. the pelmeni tasted nicely rich from the meat and even better when dunked into the sour cream",
          "Me and my partner went to this bakery on the 30th of December at around 11 AM. It got really crowded in like 30 min or so. We got the mushroom and potato piroshi, sweeet cheese and beef blinchiki, strawberry cream turnover, hazelnut financier, eclairs and napoleon cake.\nThe sweet dishes were definitely good. We also liked the Pirsoshki. For a group of Indians, blinchiki might not hit the spot very well (obviously because we wanted some spice/ onions and green chilies probably in the beef filling), but I would definitely recommend this place.\nSan Francisco prices-so not super wallet friendly.",
          "A hidden gem in SF. Find this place and find a little slice of Heaven in the Richmond district.\nGreat huge selection of baked goods and Russian specialities like Peroshki, and dumplings, pastries and cookies great coffee and tea.\nNice seating area out on the sidewalk. I often stop here when visiting the city or doing an airport run. Fun place to take visitors to.\nHighly recommended!"

          "It IS what it’s claimed to be — they are one of the best croissant makers in the city. I got a chocolate almond croissant with a drip coffee and it was fantastic. It was buttery, creamy, plump, and flaky. The almond filling balances the flavor of the rich dark chocolate. Absolutely amazing.\n\nI got there at around noon on a Saturday and there was still a line, but it went fast. I didn’t wait for more than 10 minutes before I got my pastry and coffee.\n\n(2026 Feb 7, Saturday)",
          "Delicious and fresh!!!\nFor all the vegetarians who don’t like egg washed croissants this is the place!!! None of the  croissants had that eggy flavor the baker aroma is so good you will walk in to this place involuntarily!! Will keep visiting during our stay. Must eat here. The savory pastry was so tasty!!!\nService was so charming, the girls working there were so lively and helpful."

Definitely enjoyed the two croissants we had."

The coffee cake is rich and comforting, with that melts into a perfectly moist crumb. Every pastry feels thoughtfully made, indulgent without being heavy. Service was fast with no wait at all, and parking was easy and stress-free. Truly some of the best baked goods the city has to offer.",

The dressing of the salad was good. If you want a quick breakfast, this place is ok. Prices are on the expensive though (spent about $33 for just 3 items).\n\nWe were not able to try their beverages because we brought our own. Maybe next time we can try their coffee."

          "First time visit as we were actually headed for a nearby establishment.  We walked by and saw the menu out front, the cheery interior and decided to give it a try.  We lucked out on a weekend (arrived early) and were seated without a wait.  The staff was warm and welcoming.  Food came fast.  The variety on the menu was impressive and I loved the Thai additions.  Other than my Thai sausage being a bit gristly, everything was great.  The flavor of the sausage added a nice variation on the regular breakfast fare found elsewhere.  The lattes were adorable and post worthy in themselves.  Agree with other reviewers that the ube latte is beyond cute, if sweet drinks are not for you, opt for a regular or matcha latte.  The proprietor (or Management?)came to our table to check in which is always a nice touch.  We are really happy with this serendipitous stop for breakfast.  Don’t think twice about it, just go.",
          "My husband and I came here on a Saturday morning around 10:30 and got a table right away. The staff was so friendly and the lattes and food were amazing. I can’t think of anything I would change about this place and I hope we get to try it again next time we visit San Francisco. 10/10. I had the Thai Panang omelette and it was like a cup of beef curry wrapped in egg. It was just the right amount of spicy and sweet. Reminded me of Khao soi which is my favorite Thai dish. The dressing on the salad was perfection and the potatoes were just a little crispy and so light and airy. My husband got the chicken and waffles and it was by far the best we’ve ever tried. The chicken was perfectly crispy and juicy. And the drinks are so cute and delicious. Don’t hesitate to try this place out."

          "This brunch restaurant has a comfortable atmosphere, uses fresh ingredients, maintains high hygiene standards, and provides excellent service. I'll definitely come back here again.",
          "Just over a year ago, my family and I visited 8 AM Brunchbin for the first time, and we walked away talking about two things: how good the food was and how genuinely kind and attentive the customer service felt. That combination stuck with us so much that on this trip, we made it a point to come back—and ended up eating breakfast here two days in a row.\n\nThe food is exactly as we remembered: incredibly fresh, simply prepared, and absolutely bursting with flavor. The lox bagel was perfect, and the waffle might be one of the best I’ve ever had. We actually found ourselves debating how the cooks manage to make something so straightforward taste so exceptional.\n\nThe service is still top‑tier—friendly, patient, and welcoming in a way that makes you feel like they’re truly happy you’re there.\n\nHighly recommended. This place has earned a permanent spot on our San Francisco must‑visit list.",
          "I stopped here around 10 AM on a Saturday. It was busy so we had to wait a few minutes for a table. The service here was great and very quick. I had the open faced bagel with avocado, egg and ham - it was a great combo. The fruit cup that came with it was very generous and fresh. I also had a crepe with peanut butter and banana. It was delicious. I would definitely recommend stopping here."

Especially the whipped cream. The fruits were also very fresh. Potatoes could have been more crispier. Omelette was average. Tater tots were very well seasoned and crunchy.\n\nService was perfect. Everyone was polite and nice and it was fast service.",
          "Delicious brunch if you've got a sweet tooth! My friend and I arrived on a Sunday just past 1pm and were seated right away. We ordered the sweet board for 2 with brioche French toast, pancakes, and sausage. The board came with fresh strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, eggs, and toppings of syrup, Nutella, and berry butter. We also ordered a side of tater tots as the board didn't come with any potatoes. The board was beautifully presented everything tasted delicious. My friend loved the Nutella and I was a big fan of the berry butter! We honestly didn't even need the tator tots as the board was quite filling. My Friend also ordered a strawberry matcha latte, which she said was quite good! Highly recommend!",
          "Great coffee with generous food portion sizes. Unfortunately, there were a couple of letdowns; the bread served with the omelette was very hard and overcooked, and the pancakes didn’t arrive with the choc chips as ordered. The café lacks a little atmosphere but is clearly very popular, so getting in early is recommended.\nNote that an automatic 20% gratuity is added to the bill for groups of four or more."

Service was ok, food was delicious and tasty, portions were small, and atmosphere was great! My favorite was the citrus batter french toast!",
          "Well worth the wait. Came on a busy weekend and there was a line … ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table so not too bad. They make a good cup of coffee, and the service is pretty fast. I ordered the eggs with tots, and upgraded to the millionaires bacon, which was fabulous. Totally lived up to the hype. The omelette was also great, loved the multi color home potatoes. Will definitely come back. Yum!!!",
          "Delicious food and friendly service! The line may look long but moves pretty quickly, especially if you’re willing to sit outside in cooler weather. The Bay Bottom Omelet is one of my favorites and comes with a generous serving of crab. Their bread is AMAZING. The fried french toast is good but tastes like dessert/fair food, so be prepared! The millionaire bacon is melt-in-your-mouth, sweet, and spicy. It’s worth trying at least once. The food is always quality!"

          "I tried this spot for Sunday brunch based on its great reviews. We had a reservation, but for parties of two, it seemed walk-in seating was readily available—several two-tops remained open during our meal. However, a group of five that arrived before us wasn’t seated until we were almost done. So, I’d definitely recommend a reservation for any group larger than two.\n\nMy main draw was the famous savory beignets. I ordered the crawfish beignets, and wow, they were dense! A set of three is served, and after about one and a half, I was surprisingly full, which impacted the rest of my meal. The tables are quite small, so the staff waits for you to finish appetizers before bringing out mains.\n\nFor my entree, I got the Creole platter to sample a variety. In hindsight, I wish I’d chosen the seafood gumbo. The catfish batter didn't adhere well and fell off, and the only side I truly enjoyed was the beans, sausage, and rice.\n\nParking: Some street parking is available, but the area didn't feel especially safe. I took public transit, walking from Civic Center Station.\n\nService: Was good.\n\nBest Part: The beignets. I would return just for these.\n\nWorst Part: The table size. I understand the need to maximize seating, but the tables are very small. With two plates, it's cramped, and the outer seat has to sit close to avoid the waitstaff.\n\nTip: Make a reservation in advance, especially for groups over two.\n\nReturn? Yes, but primarily for the beignets.",
          "Echo all the great reviews here. Quick service at 10:00 am on a Saturday morning. Pork belly grits were delicious. Nice and hot. Great crisp on the pork. Lots of good cheese and poached egg too. Spicy onion jam was really good. Croque Monsieur and slaw was good. Got the 3 way (plain, apple, chocolate) beignets. My fave was the plain, just because I like a pure beignet, but the chocolate and apple were also good. Good place to go!",
          "We had a wonderful breakfast here. The staff was friendly, warm, and on top of everything. Water service was great and I appreciated that they offered half orders for several items.\n\nThe Bananas Foster French toast was amazing, rich without being too sweet. The andouille sausage was fantastic and full of flavor, and the strawberry jam was truly heavenly. I also had an iced Grandma’s Coffee with black walnut and whipped cream, which was delicious and felt like such a fun treat.\n\nWe ordered the beignets too. They were a little dense, but the flavor was still very good.\n\nOverall, a great breakfast spot with excellent service and food that really stands out. I would definitely go back."

Their main dish portions are huge and the food is great. I like to take miss Mymy with lemon ricotta pancakes, poached eggs and beacon. The service is friendly and nice despite the place being packed at all times. The prices are also fair for the amount and quality of food you get!",
          "This was the best brunch I’ve found so far in SF. I got the Baja California Benedict and it blew me away! It came with a very generous portion of dungeness crab. The hollandaise complimented the crab meat beautifully but didn’t overpower it. The pile of shrimp on the side was a pleasant, delicious surprise! And the crispy potatoes were everything you could ask for in a crispy potato. Perfect for scooping up the last bits of yolk and sauce.\n\nIncredible meal and great service. I had no wait as a single diner on a Friday morning. Thank you so much! I can’t wait to come back!",
          "MyMy serves brunch with a level of precision that makes every dish feel engineered. The French toast is the standout: the salted butter is the key, and the bread has a texture close to bread pudding without collapsing. The burger is solid, but it’s better with the side salad instead of fries because the greens are fresher and pair well with the rest of the menu. The lobster eggs Benedict is best ordered with low mayo, which keeps the dish balanced, and the potato wedges are the strongest part of the plate. They’re cooked evenly, crisp on the outside, soft inside, and best with a little extra salt and Tapatía hot sauce."

          "Food was outstanding! Wonderful lite beet salad with avocado. Loved the hazelnuts on the salmon and risotto. Husband loved the baked chicken and noodles. Very clean and nice interior. Josh was an excellent server and the crème brûlée was the best I’ve had in years!",
          "Stopped here for brunch with a friend and very much enjoyed the food and the service. I had the La Mer Benedict with two eggs which was a good portion and a tasty mimosa. The server was attentive and the food came out without much of a wait. The weather was nice enough to enjoy sitting outside.",
          "Overall, a decent experience.\nHighlights: the Albert eggs benedict was delicious and the buttermilk pancake was very good (way better than the gingerbread and french toast in the Sarah Jane's flight.)\n\nLow points: the hot chocolate was really watered down. Also, I really worry about the sanitary conditions of this place. The bathroom, the dishwashing, and the pass where the finished food sits before being served is all right next to each other and it's also the choke point where patrons walk through to get to the back area seating. The floor was also really slippery in this area."

          "Super cute Café with friendly service.\n\nWe sat at the counter because the place was already packed, and that was our only option. Glad we did as we were served by the lovely April.\n\nThe coffee was amazing. So many other restaurants have incredibly strong and really bitter coffee and this was perfectly smooth and balanced. There are  lots of options for trying creative drinks and cocktails.\n\nFor breakfast I enjoyed the avocado toast with egg and tomatoes. My husband ordered the french onion soup which he gave thumbs up.\n\nWill definitely return.",
          "Came in on a Saturday without a reservation and got a table in about 30 min. It was well worth the wait. Everything on the menu looked good, but we ended up going with the classic Benedict and the country scramble. Both very good. The drink and cocktail menu was also very good. My favorite being “the secret”, a lychee cocktail. The interior is very cute and art deco style with a library wall. I will absolutely be coming back.",
          "I was late to my reservation due to a BART delay and they graciously moved my time for me. When I arrived, I had my bag and my backpack for my mini vacation. They didn't treat me like an inconvenience at all. Some restaurants are very lacking in their customer service, and they would have given me subpar service. The waiters were attentive and the food was great, except for one small piece of egg shell. I have done that before while cooking. And I was coming in with 40 minutes to spare for their operational hours, so, they were probably rushed. I totally understand. I also understand that when I get eggshell in my food it is because I am not professionally trained. The atmosphere was very pleasant, so was the decor. The matcha latte and tiger stripe latte were both delicious, and every bite of the florentine eggs benedict, except that last bite, was delicious. I was kinda disappointed, but everything in life can't be perfect. Solid 4 stars!\n\nP.S. Be careful with the potatoes they're lava inside. My mouth is burned. Let them sit for like 5 minutes plus before eating them. They may look OK to eat, but no, they're literally lava.\n\nI looked it up and restaurants are supposed to tell you the food is hot, especially if it isn't visible. I came to San Francisco for a 3 day feast, with reservations at various restaurants around the city, and this 1st restaurant ruined it for me. It's day 2 and I'm settling for anything on the menu that isn't hot at my second reservation this morning. Kinda upset about it. I'll have to visit again, but I will avoid Sisterita at all costs. Even if it were free, I don't appreciate negligence."

          "Reservation required!\n\nOne of the best gems in the city for vegan sushi. Amazing ambiance, service, and decor.\n\nLot of great options - highly recommend the Boddy & Souli, and Candlestick sushi.\n\nDon't skip their dessert of the day!",
          "All vegan Japanese restaurant that has celiac-safe GF options - wow! Super excited to try this place so when I was in the area at 4:15 last Sunday, having missed lunch, thought I’d stop by. Was surprised to see there were already people waiting for it to open and the line was quite long when it opened at 4:30. Reservations are recommended but we were lucky enough to be accommodated. A charming dining area, albeit not a ton of elbow room. Seating options include tables up to four, up to two, and a small sushi bar.\n\nThe waitstaff were very friendly and responsive and helpful with recommendations.\n\nFood wise, everything was good, including the miso soup and yuba salad, but the rolls are where the magic is. They’re all beautifully crafted and presented. We tried the California roll (great!), sweet tofu nigiri, Missing piece (made GF), and Boddy and Soul (recommended, and a winner by my dining partner, but not GF).\n\nIt was a real delight to enjoy such delicious food, carefully created, crafted, and presented, making it a multi sensory treat.\n\nWish there was a GF tempura option to make more of the rolls available to celiacs, but I loved what I had. Definitely recommend the fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere and uniquely Japanese vibe. Think stylish onsen, an indulgence where you leave feeling fulfilled, healthy, and happy!",
          "Delicious vegan sushi that actually delivers on flavor! The Dynamite Roll (10/10) was the highlight, followed closely by the Roasted Bell Pepper Nigiri (9/10). The Shishito Peppers and Candlestick roll were also solid (8/10).\n\nThe price point feels high given the portion sizes, but the technique is impressive and it gives vegans a genuine sushi experience. Highly recommended for the execution, especially if you don't eat fish."

We sat at the sushi bar with a great view to watch them work their magic. I got the jackalope which was recommended by our sever and it was so good and I also ordered the Fresco which was also really yummy. My husband got sashimi of all kinds and loved it all. We also got a seaweed salad which was great too.",
          "This was my second visit to Kuma Sushi within one month, and that alone says everything. Flew from NJ today and came straight here for lunch; After how incredible our first experience was, we had to come back and somehow, it was even better the second time.\n\nThe chef is truly outstanding. You can taste the care, skill, and passion in every single bite. The quality of the fish is superb fresh, clean, and perfectly prepared and the rolls are honestly out of this world. Every dish feels thoughtfully crafted, not rushed or ordinary.\n\nKuma Sushi has officially become one of those rare places you crave long after you leave. We will absolutely be loyal customers going forward. If you’re in San Francisco and love exceptional sushi, this place is a must.\n\nHighly, highly recommend. 🍣✨"

          "My wife and I went as our Valentine's date night, expecting maybe a quiet-ish time at the bar and some polite banter perhaps with our chef and maybe the couples next to us. What we got instead quite by happy happenstance was a rollicking good time chatting with the super friendly couples next to us at the bar, while our chef JK obliged with friendly comments within our conversation while still preparing the delectable courses of the omakase. Of course, the happenstance of the chatty friendly couples sitting next to us can't be replicated, but our chef JK really rolled with it and knew how to adjust the service to the cadence of our conversation -- our lucky accidental group ended up being the last guests at the restaurant, at which time the chefs broke out some japanese sake for us on the house, and we proceeded to chat another 20 minutes before leaving with the distinct conclusion that this was unquestionably the best time we have ever had at an omakase and that we shall return!",
          "ju-ni focuses on the fish with some delicious nigiri pieces, but overall the ambiance & service was distracting and overpriced for the number of pieces served. overall, glad I tried it and loved the standout pieces, but wouldn’t recommend.\n\nservice: our chef wasn’t bad but the difference of service between our seating and the one next to us was night and day. ended up listening to the other chef more since he explained each dish with detail while ours mumbled his way through.\n\nstandout dishes: fatty tuna, red snapper, salmon roe with monkfish pate",
          "Ju-Ni literally means “twelve” in Japanese, a nod to the original 12-seat counter and the tight, timed omakase format. Service is mostly nigiri, paced one piece at a time, with a lot of torch work at the counter.  ￼ Chef-owner Geoffrey Lee’s signature bite is the “ikura with ankimo”: salmon roe topped with shaved, deep-frozen ankimo (monkfish liver, often called “foie gras of the sea”). Lee has described it as “our dish at Ju-Ni,” and it’s a standout.  ￼"

          "Very upscale lovely steak and seafood restaurant. The omakase offering is a variety of their signature and most sort after menu items. They are not small portions by any means, all meticulously crafted by the chef as a beautiful way to explore their menu.\nEverything from A5+ Wagyu to lobster tail and a dessert selection. I won't tell too much as to give away the experience of being in the chef hands - but I can say they are good hands to be in. Thankyou for this special meal on our 20th wedding anniversary.",
          "Contemporary, but excellent. I've been to dozens of omakases, but this one was super unique, easily in my top 3. Besides sashimi, nigiri, and the usual hot stuff, they had a huge lobster tail, wagyu, and an amazing dessert platter. I was so stuffed I had to take 20% of it home. Definitely recommend this unique experience.",
          "Pros: the food was well prepared and promptly delivered. We sat in the downstairs area that was giving speakeasy vibes and I really enjoyed it. If you are sensitive to sound though, you may not like it during prime time because when it fills up, it is very loud in there. I didn’t mind it, but I know some people like a more peaceful surrounding in which case the upstairs would’ve probably been better.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, we had a good variety of food and I particularly like my dessert to come out with my supper and they delivered on that request properly.\n\nThe coffee machine was broken, which was a disappointment so I ended up having green tea with my dessert, but was still enjoyable.\n\nThe crispy Brussels were perfect, and the dessert was the perfect amount of rich and flavorful. I do believe the dessert was a bit overpriced, but it was a work dinner that a client paid for so I can’t complain too much.\n\nCons: nothing significant. Our server was great and even got us a complementary hot plate to try. We only got delayed slightly with my tea, but it didn’t ruin the experience."

          "I had an amazing experience at Zentarou Sushi and Sake Bar! The omakase here is truly impressive, especially for the price. Every piece of fish was incredibly fresh, well-balanced, and thoughtfully prepared. You can really feel the chef’s passion—each course was explained with care, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.\n\nThe selection had a great mix of classic cuts and creative bites that made the whole experience memorable. The portions were just right, and I left feeling satisfied without being overly full. The ambiance is cozy and welcoming, and the staff were attentive, friendly, and made the experience even better.\n\nFor the quality you get, Zentarou offers one of the best and most affordable omakase experiences in the area. I’ll definitely be coming back and recommending it to anyone who loves sushi!",
          "Zentarou has outstanding tableside service, even when the restaurant is busy. The staff is attentive and genuinely takes care of your needs. I really enjoyed the umeshu plum wine, and the omakase is a must-try—the fish is very high quality. The menu changes every season, which keeps things fresh and interesting. The cozy atmosphere makes the experience even better. Highly recommend.",
          "The food is seriously top-notch—super fresh, beautifully made, and perfectly balanced. Every bite feels thoughtful, like real care went into it. This is sushi done right, with zero shortcuts.\n\nThe drinks deserve their own shoutout. They’re creative, well thought out, and pair incredibly well with the food. Definitely not your average sushi bar cocktails or sake list.\n\nWhat really makes the place special, though, is the people. Chef Zen’s passion and creativity shine through at the counter, and Beach is one of the friendliest, most attentive servers you’ll meet—welcoming, genuine, and always checking in without being overbearing.\n\nGreat food, fun and inventive drinks, and warm hospitality all around. This is the kind of place you leave already planning your next visit."

          "The food is average. Red curry is too sweet. The roast pork was above average and the pork with basil was the best amongst the dishes ordered. Their take away portions were of decent size and hence pretty fair pricing for local standards. Restaurant size is big but service a little slow in terms of food prep. Staff were friendly and helpful.",
          "Great Asian cuisine with a solid menu selection. The food was delicious, reasonably priced, and the portion sizes were just right. The décor really adds to the experience, with beautiful Thai artwork throughout the venue and an incredible elephant feature wall that really stands out.\n\nHowever, the night I visited felt quite chaotic. The restaurant seemed short-staffed, and the waitress was clearly under the pump doing her best. Unfortunately, this meant long waits for meals, and even food delivery drivers were visibly frustrated by delays.\n\nOverall, tasty food and a lovely setting, but the service experience would definitely improve with a few extra staff on shift.",
          "5 star experience. We ordered red curry, mango shrimp salad, eggplant basil chicken sautee and all were flavorful and delicious. Piping hot entrees perfect for a cold day."

          "Awesome food. And im picky about my Thai food  we ordered the green papaya salad, Silver noodle salad, the barbecued pork, and Tom Kah soup. Every single plate was excellent 👍 Service was great, lots of space and very open with large windows. The area is a little difficult for parking, Service is fast. Overall EXCELLENT food and VERY good prices....much less expensive than other restaurants. We were a large group of seven, but everything went smooth and fast.",
          "The new location is 1 block away from the old location which is great!\n\nThe interior is very homey, spacious and great for large groups, families and kids!! Large menu that accommodates all palates.\n\nI sampled the two poplar boat noodles (small sizes). They were so unique, punchful and super delicious!!!\n\nTo top it off, the service was inviting and welcoming!! Definitely an A++ eatery.",
          "They moved!  I like their new location A LOT better than the previous.  It’s in a better (safer) neighborhood.  I absolutely LOVE the boat noodle.  It’s what I get every time.  The beef version is fire.  The broth is so bold and full of flavor.  Tiny bits of fried pork rind top the noodle.  Yum!  This time though the pork belly with Chinese greens was not good.  The pork belly was dry and over fried."

The servers are very nice and willing to help but sometimes seem a bit lost - took quite a while to pay and pack our leftovers. But it could just be that they're new. Other than that the service was great, the food arrived quickly."

          "As a new California resident, I've been loving the experience of exploring so many new restaurants across San Francisco and the Bay Area. I tried Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine for a weekend lunch, and overall, it was a great experience.\n\nWe started with Thai tea, which tasted good, but the giant ice ball added mainly for presentation was a bit of a mood killer--it looked nice but diluted the drink quickly.\n\nThe crispy egg rolls were delicious--perfectly crispy and flavorful, a great way to start the meal.\n\nWe  also ordered chicken tom kha. It was very tasty, with big pieces of chicken and vegetables, but it felt more like a stir fry than a soup. I personally wished it had a bit more soup\n\nFor the mains, we ordered the chicken red curry with blue jasmine rice. The curry itself was absolutely delightful--rich, comforting, and full of flavor. However, the blue jasmine rice didn't really add anything to the taste. It looks great for Instagram shots, but you can easily skip it and stick to regular white rice.\n\nWe also ordered the Thai fried rice, which was a total flavor bomb--so good that I actually forgot to take a photo of it!\n\nTheir Mother's Sauce deserves a special mention--it's incredibly delicious but very spicy, so be careful if you can't handle the heat.\n\nThe ambience is very cute, and the service was fast, making the overall experience enjoyable.\n\nDefinitely going back--there's still so much on the menu to try!",
          "Delicious food, great vibes, and fun, friendly servers, it’s all there. The staff went out of their way to recommend some of their appetizers, which were incredible, crispy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. Every dish we tried had a perfect balance of flavors, from savory to spicy, and the portions were generous without being overwhelming. The curries were rich and comforting, the noodles had just the right texture, and the fresh herbs really elevated each dish. On top of that, the decor is playful and visually striking, making it a fun spot for photos as well. Between the flavorful food, welcoming service, and cool atmosphere, it’s definitely a place I’d recommend checking out.",
          "This isn’t tampered down Thai food! I enjoyed our meal so much; the meat dishes are cooked and seasoned and spiced to perfection. We didn’t celebrate anything while we were there but we witnessed two birthdays: if you want a fun celebration experience, you should go there, it’s loud and vibrant! When I travel back to SF, I’m definitely coming back."

Simple decor and setup inside.\nThe crowd inside and continuous flow of the online delivery personnel does indicate its popularity.\nHad a papaya salad with grilled prawns as a starter followed by Spicy Green Bean Chicken and Pineapple Fried Rice. All sumptuous though the salad was a bit spicier than what we are used to. Ample portions and we had to cancel another dish based on the serving size (which they cancelled without any issue).\nService was good but seemed understaffed.\nOverall, a fulfilling experience. Definitely value for money."

          "It's funny because we found this place from a random short in YouTube, but the food was really good - probably the top 3 best things we tried were the Moo Hong, the Kaya toast, and Khao Soi Pad Haeng.\n\nWe went right at open and lined up around 3:20 and we were 8th in line. By the time it was 4 PM the line was at the end of the block. And we were already being seated. I would wait at this place for maybe 30 minutes tops, but it definitely was a good experience.\n\nFood wasn't really spicy enough would be my only complaint, but it mostly felt like Thai fusion which isn't a bad thing, but you shouldn't expect traditional Thai cuisine coming here.",
          "Service was great with a kind and attentive team! Food was good with a particular shout out to the khao soi and duck curry (much debate as to which was a fav amongst friends). The Kaya toast was a clear winner out of everything. And pad see ew was a surprisingly good contender that one south bay area local said was the best they've had.\n\nTom yum was good but not the best I've ever had. Still a delicious dish on a cold, rainy winter day. The spicy wonton was decent, we enjoyed the sauce.",
          "On a cold Wednesday evening in October, I was hoping for a delicious date night spot and Khao Tiew delivered. Though relatively new, this place has received a lot of acclaim for the food and because of that I knew I had to try it out for myself. After joining the waitlist (YOU MUST BE WITHIN 1 MILE TO JOIN), we had about 45 minutes to wait around 6:00. However we blew by that time by hanging out and checking out shops in West Portal, which unfortunately were mostly closed by that time. Anyways, after getting seated inside we decided on the Crab Fried Rice in a Claypot, the Khao Soi, the Duck Breast Red Curry, and the Crispy Papaya Salad. I enjoyed everything a lot. The crab fried rice was rich and had a really nice savory and subtle sweet flavor. The Khao Soi was probably the best I’ve ever had and it honestly did not even need the meat add on. The Duck Breast Red Curry was surprisingly fresh and rich, while the duck was super tender. Finally, the Crispy Papaya Salad was really unique and I've never had a papaya salad in this form. What we ordered was more than enough for 3 people, so I wouldn’t do much more than that. Anyways, I am super glad we came and I will definitely recommend this place as one of the best thai foods I have had in the bay."

          "Really solid Thai food. The papaya salad was crisp, fresh and perfectly acidic and spicy. Pad Thai was excellent—just enough sauce without any sogginess. Lived the vegetable curry too. Everything was very tasty.\n\nStaff was friendly and accommodated our stroller. Great restaurant."

          "Tried a bunch of dishes here and everything was amazing and authentic!\n\nThe shrimp paste fried rice was great—super flavorful with lots of toppings (a must if you like bold flavors). The five spice pork leg, crying tiger, and salted egg yolk squid were all perfect, while the tom saap pork ribs tasted super authentic and spicy (just wished for a touch more lime). Even the wings and papaya salad were on point.\n\nDrinks were great too—especially the Blaco Margarita (smooth and tasty without being heavy on alcohol). Overall, this place nails authentic Thai flavors with great execution. Definitely recommend if you’re into bold, spicy, and savoury dishes!",
          "This my second time eating in this restaurant. I did not take pic of my first visit but I ordered their spring roll and pork belly rice meal. Somehow, this is a so so food. For the second time, I tried their pad thai with prawns and fried fish cake. This is good better than food i ordered in my first visit. They take order and serve food fast. The price is on the expensive side but the food quality is good. The vibes in the restaurant is very good. They have large tv with a bar. Very good for drinking and watching sports."

We were able to get their Peking Duck and we were able to get more pancakes. Overall, it was a good experience. We definitely would consider coming back. Just note they do charge an automatic 8% to your bill for a San Francisco service fee.",

The Peking duck was delicious, and even the green beans were a solid side. Everything we tried was well-executed and flavorful. Highly recommend for anyone looking for quality Chinese cuisine with standout seafood dishes.\n\nS/o to AiDa for great service too!"

I'm not sure why the review score is so high, but my expectation for an authentic, flavorful Hunan food was definitely not met.\n\nWe went in during a weekend dinner and there were very few people - kind of already indicating the place is not so popular.\n\nWe tried House smoked beef jerky and house special tofu. Although both looked fine, they were really lacking the flavor. I can taste some saltiness but not much more. I was actually surprised because the smoky Beef jerky didn't have actually the smoke flavor.\n\nService was so-so. After we sat at a table, the owner asked us whether we needed water. When we asked to pack our leftover food, they were trying to give us fewer boxes and asked if we can stack different dishes together.\n\nSuitable for a quick meal but not the nice vibe - The restaurant is small in a fast food style and not for large parties."

          "After closure of Oriental Pearl Restaurant, we are still searching for a near close joint… this place is on the first floor, just like Oriental Pearl, a bit difficult to carry a stroller upstairs… restaurant was 70% full when we arrived at around 6:30 pm, the soup was very standard, nothing exceptional though, had to add condiments to elevate taste…Potsticker was stuffed with chicken, crab Rangoon was good, Chow Mein and Chicken Entree was great…the house noodles was also very good, but limited prawns and chicken in it… the fried rice was again standard. It’s an all women run joint, very attentive and prompt in service.",
          "My wife and I had dinner here last night while celebrating our Anniversary.\n\nParking is a little difficult to locate in this area, so we had to drive around for a bit.\n\nThe space is up a flight of stairs and there is no elevator. It us a family style restaurant so they have found tables with turntables in the middle for the sharing of food. They have about 10 tables. The restaurant itself is cute and very connected to the Asian culture\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived, there were 2 free tables available. Yes, they are created for larger parties. However, many of them were. They placed us at a table to share with another 2 ppl party. We did not like this at all. As a guest at a restaurant, we deserved the right to have our own table. It was a totally inconvenience to the ppl that were already at the table. Btw.. one was a Trans. I keep wondering why they sat us at no other table with others that were also 2 ppl. Why this table?\n\nWe observed a YT couple walk in and placed at their own large table. We them observed 3 Asians walk in and they were placed at a vet large table.\n\nMy wife and I did not hold much of a conversation because it was weird!!\n\nThe service was accomodating until midway through even our waitress never came back up check on us or ask if we needed anything. Honestly.. we did not even receive water now that I think of it.\n\nThe food was hot when it came out. I was not a fan of the wonton soup. It lacked flavor. I enjoyed the House Noodles (shrimp, chicken and beef).. but it needed seasoning or more flavor. We ordered chicken wings. That was delicious. We also ordered fried string beans and pork. That was so good!!!\n\nMy wife had a Chinese beer and I had a cold Sake served in a bottle.\n\nWhen we were ready to pack up the leftover food, it had to sit because or efforts to be seen by a waitress to receive a box and bag was ignored. When we finally got the attention of another one, they immediately brought the check. Did not even ask if we needed a box.\n\nOh.. prices are really good and cheap. You get alot of food.\n\nI reccomend this place, with reservations depending on your race or appearing lifestyle.",
          "I was so happy to go to San Francisco for my birthday. My husband treated me to dinner in Chinatown at Hong Kong Clay Pot. Everything we ate was thoroughly enjoyed. From the salt and pepper chicken wings to the Chicken Clay Pot with chicken, sausage, mushrooms and onions.This is a no-frills restaurant, but all the food is bursting with flavor."

          "Absolutely beautiful.  First time here. There was so much food to choose from! You can buy fresh delicacies here. Great for walking..although parking was hard. Tuesday & Thursday are street  cleaning days..so parking was limited. The people were both friendly and helpful.",
          "Chinatown SF is amazing. No matter how long I live in this city I am always gonna be in awe of Chinatown. I bought a lot of different dried mushrooms to make a rice with mushroom sauce dish, and it was delicious. You should challenge yourself and walk up any of the steep streets, like Jones St, get yourself a good leg workout. I ended up going up Jones and down California, and ran into Ossa Steakhouse, Grace Cathedral, and The Fairmont. Just GORGEOUS. Then you can go back down and get some good food on any of the streets running through Chinatown. My fave spot is Osmanthus for delicious dim sum. You can go into any of the dumpling restaurants too. There was one (forgetting the name) that had a super long line. There is just so much to see! The next time I go to Chinatown, I am going to buy a silk floral pattern robe from a store I ran into on Grant (I think).All in all, I had a great Sunday.",
          "We had a nice time exploring San Francisco's Chinatown on our recent trip. As one of the oldest and largest Chinatowns in North America, it offered an immersive dive into Chinese culture right in the heart of the city. Walking around the bustling streets was a highlight – from the iconic Dragon Gate entrance to the colorful murals, lanterns, and historic architecture, every corner felt alive with history and energy. We loved popping into the authentic tea shops, dim sum spots, and markets selling everything from fresh herbs to intricate souvenirs. The mix of locals and tourists created a lively atmosphere that made us feel like we were in a different world.\n\nThat said, it can get quite crowded, especially on weekends, which made navigating the narrow sidewalks a bit challenging at times. Still, the cultural richness and the chance to try some amazing street food more than made up for it.\n\nOverall, Chinatown is a must-visit for anyone wanting to experience San Francisco's diverse side."

          "# Culinary Heights, Service Lows, and a Deafening Beat\n\nMister Jiu’s, occupying an expansive and pleasant space in San Francisco’s Chinatown, is rightly renowned for its take on Chinese cuisine. The kitchen delivers a formidable array of thoughtful improvements on traditional dishes alongside new creations that use familiar techniques in fresh ways. In purely culinary terms, it rises well past many similarly priced restaurants in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nUnfortunately, that excellence is significantly marred by both ambience and front-of-house execution. Start with the ambience: while the space is meticulously decorated, the tables are comfortably spaced, and the restrooms are sparkling clean, the dining room is overwhelmed by incredibly loud electronic dance music—music better suited to a nightclub or dive bar than to a high-end restaurant where people come to taste, talk, and linger. The volume, which we estimate at roughly 80–100 dB, eliminated any realistic chance of conversation and forced us into shouting exchanges, including with the staff.\n\nThe staff, unfortunately, matched the chaotic energy of the room rather than the precision of the kitchen. Basic operational issues kept recurring: calls to the restaurant went to voicemail with a message stating that “this mailbox is full and doesn’t accept new messages.” At the table, utensils and sauces arrived slowly and only after reminders. Plates were not reliably cleared or exchanged between courses without repeat requests. Even the dining table—visibly soiled—was not wiped before dessert was served. None of these are “small details” in a restaurant of this ambition and price point; they are core competencies.\n\nThe Michelin Guide reviewers would likely agree that excellence requires more than a great kitchen. It requires a functional, attentive front of the house and an environment that supports the dining experience. This is where Mister Jiu’s currently falls short.\n\nAs ordinary consumers, we are not paid or compensated in any way for this review. We hope management recognizes that the restaurant’s extraordinary food deserves equally competent service and a dining-room atmosphere that matches its reputation.",
          "Came here almost by chance and left completely impressed. I didn’t even know it had a Michelin star, we came because my husband had seen a Spanish chef we love post about it on Instagram during his SF visit. What a find.\n\nThe place feels super hidden, right in the middle of Chinatown, and the second we sat down we both thought, “Okay, this place is different.” Everything we ordered was so good: lamb dumplings, sizzled petrale sole, fried rice, plus a cocktail for my husband, not a single miss.\n\nAlso, the service made the night even better. Big thanks to David and Jovi for being amazing.\n\n1000% recommend. One of those spots you’re genuinely excited to tell people about.",
          "Great vibes and great food with generous portions. While a bit pricey, I think it was worth the experience. I’d definitely order everything again except maybe the eggplant.\n\nEverything off the snacks/classics portion of the menu (milk bread, turnip cake, beef tendon) were delicious twists on more traditional versions of the dishes. Make sure to dip the milk bread in the beef tendon oil for a different flavor profile.\n\nThe uni cheong fun was expensive but definitely one of the best versions of the dish I’ve had.\n\nThe grilled pork chops were incredibly juicy but it’s not for everyone with its strong flavors and spicy bitter melons\n\nThe only thing I’d not get again is eggplant, which felt very average and nothing special."

          "I am visiting from OC and wanted a true Chinatown foodie experience. I am so excited I came here and got to experience this. Genuinely made me feel like Anthony Bourdain with the level of flavor. If you come here you're coming for the hand pulled noodles and the dumplings. We got the orange chicken and it was pretty mid but the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and the Pork dumplings in chili oil were to die for. I would genuinely eat this everyday if I could.\n\nThe noodles were perfectly cooked. They kept their bouncy texture all through the meal and soaked up the dynamite flavor of the broth. The beef was so tender and flavorful. I'll be dreaming of the broth and noodles tonight for certain.\n\nThe pork dumplings alone were cooked perfectly and burst with flavor (literally) with every bite. The addition of the chili oil was chefs kiss. Best dimsum I've ever had.\n\nThank you San Francisco for stealing my foodie heart. I'll never forget this experience. Love love love!",
          "My friend ordered the chicken and cabbage dumplings and I ordered the Shanghai pan fried pork buns and braised beef noodle soup. The pan fried pork buns were a bit dry and not that flavorful on their own, but with some chili oil, soy sauce, and vinegar it was good. The braised beef noodle soup was some of the BEST I’ve ever had. The noodles seemed to be freshly hand pulled, the beef was so tender, and the broth was rich and very well/seasoned. Prices were good and they do take card/Apple pay, which was very convenient. Food arrived quickly and the atmosphere was very hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.",
          "We stopped by this little spot - more of a hole-in-the-wall than a full restaurant. Tried two kinds of shrimp dumplings: the first ones were great, kind of homemade-style with thick dough and tasty filling  - really hit the spot. The second ones, the shumai, were a letdown: tiny, same price, but the filling tasted more like fish, and the little shrimp on top felt more like decoration. So, one type was delicious, the other… not so much"

          "Definitely going back if I’m in SF. If you ever wondered what kind of Chinese restaurants are good and authentic this place is. You know it’s legit when a group of Chinese family  are waiting to be seated.\nFood wise no brainer get the eggplant and shrimp. Only if you like eggplant. On a cold night get the beef winter melon soup. Warms  you up instantly. Dungeness crab may be a miss you dont mind dinging in for the meat.",
          "It had been about 17 years since I last ate at R&G lounge, because I was kind of boycotting due to receiving poor service so so long ago. With so many other restaurants to try, I was never interested in coming back until a friend told us that he loves R&G lounge so much that he eats here almost once a month, and convinced us all to have dinner there, after we were turned away from 4 Kings. R&G has been around all this time, and lots of people seem to love it, and of course I can forgive poor service nearly 2 decades ago.\nHas R&G always been so big? They put us in large table tucked away from the commotion. They have multiple floors and even have options for private dining. I can see why large parties plan events here so they can eat the usual Chinese banquet dishes.\n\n$65 Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab - whole crab battered, deep fried, sprinkled w/ salt & pepper seasoning:\ngreat! fresh & succulent fresh crab meat piled high with crispy garlic\n\n$50 Chilean Seabass (small) - marinated and baked in a glaze:\nokay! nice and tender, but due to personal preference I don't love glazed fish that much. Our other friends loved it though.\n\n$24 Roast Squab - whole squab roasted, crispy skin, w/ seasoning salt on the side\ngood! crispy skin indeed and quite juicy. Are we calling MSG = seasoning salt now? It does look quite like MSG, which I have nothing against. To me it's just another form of sodium. The tough thing about squab is it is not always easy to split up. Who gets the leg, the best part?\n\n$26 Steamed Clams & Eggs - steamed with beaten eggs:\ngood! steamed to a silky consistency\n\n$20 Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce - eggplant, black fungus, bamboo shoots & scallions sauteed in hot garlic sauce:\ngood! silky, spicy and flavorful\n\n$8 for 4 bowls of steamed rice, which we shared among 6 people, because we're too cheap to get one bowl of rice per person, but we never finish our rice anyway.\n\n3% SF Mandate is annoying, but nothing new\n\nI guess I am due to let go of the past and admit that R&G has some pretty good dishes. In fact, service this time around was pretty good. Who could remember that nearly 20 years ago, they took nearly an hour to return our credit card, so we can just conclude payment and leave, as if they were holding us hostage? Oops, I guess I do still remember. We're moving on!",
          "R&G Lounge gets two stars from me because the Peking duck experience was really disappointing. For the price and the restaurant’s reputation, the way the dish came out felt careless.\nWhat went wrong\n•\tThe Peking duck arrived at the table with several pieces already missing, so it looked like a half-finished platter instead of a whole, impressive dish.\n•\tThe duck was not deboned, which made it hard to eat and took away from the enjoyment, especially since Peking duck is usually served in neat, easy-to-wrap slices. Also, the duck arrived at our table as shown in the photo. There seems pieces were missing, I asked our server and was told that this is the way the duck is served. I have never been served a duck in such a way.\n•\tGiven how well-known this place is for special dishes and banquet-style meals, the quality and presentation of the duck fell far below expectations.\nWhy it’s two stars, not one\n•\tThe restaurant is a long-standing Chinatown spot with a big menu and a busy, lively dining room, so it clearly can do better than what we were served.\n•\tService and other dishes may be fine for some guests, but the mishandled Peking duck turned what should have been a highlight into a letdown, and that’s hard to overlook."

The food portions are pretty decent and I have to say the food is tasty so at least you get good quality food for the price you pay. The place is a little bit dated, but it is nice overall and the service is pretty good. It’s nice because it’s in the neighborhood where you can get other food as well and walk around."

Some of the best Indian food I've ever had combined with some unique items from Nepal such as dumplings that seem similar to something you would find at a dim sum restaurant. Overall, the food was outstanding, including high quality sag lamb and great naan bread too.\nThis is a family restaurant and clearly the people running it care very deeply about providing great service and great food.\nPrices are very reasonable too. We had an appetizer, two main courses, and one drink each for a total of $68 before tip."

          "Finally giving this new(ish) spot in the neighborhood now that they have some time to settle in.  Went with a Chicken Tikka Masala, Rice and some Garlic Naan. Instead of my usual go to Mango Lassi I went with a Salted Lassi. The Salted Lassi was nice and a good balance to the Masala (just know it’s a salted plain yogurt drink and not sweet like a Mango Lassi is).  Overall impressions of the food and experience is decent. Great Masala Sauce, but unfortunately the chicken was a bit dry and chewy on the day I had it. The Garlic Naan was great and very tasty with the sauce.  Value was ok, but note you have to pay $4 for rice to go with a $16 entree as rice is not included with the entree.. All in all it was a bit of a pricy lunch for one at $32 before tip. My suggestion is to go with a group to share different dishes family style. Decor is pretty basic, but very clean and nice service by staff.",
          "8/20/2025- update:\nStill as good as the first time!  The  chick pea veggie fritters were amazing!   So is the curry!  Super yummy!\n\nFirst time here and I was pleasantly surprised!  Food is very good!   I was wondering why my tea took a bit to get, they brew it and it’s milk chai.  We had the tandoori salmon and the veggie basmati rice and it was amazing!  Service is good, they are  very nice and the prices are good!  Will definitely be coming back!",
          "We were looking for a good Indian spot before heading home and Taj looked pretty solid so we gave it a shot. Had the lamb chops, Saag Paneer, coconut rice, and garlic Naan. Everything was great the lamb was cooked and seasoned to perfection! They asked about spice level for the Saag Paneer. Very tasty.  They also have a yummy Chai. Really good spot. Ill definitely come again. The service was awesome as well. Really attentive and the vibe and music is great. Loved the fresh flowers on the table."

          "We found this place on a whim and had the most incredible meal at Diwali! The menu showcases a variety of dishes with something for everyone — beautifully crisp dosas, tons of flavorful vegetarian options, and plenty of delicious meat dishes for the carnivores in our group.\n\nThe dosa was the star for me: paper-thin, perfectly crispy, and served with chutneys and sambar that tasted unbelievably fresh. Every dish we tried was layered with spice and aroma without ever being overwhelming.\n\nService is warm and welcoming, and the staff really cared about explaining dishes and helping us choose. Portions are generous, prices are fair, and the atmosphere is cozy without feeling crowded. The owner, who is incredibly passionate about sharing the flavors she loves, is so kind and attentive.\n\nWhether you’re craving comfort food, exploring new flavors, or dining with a mixed group of dietary preferences, this place nails it. We enjoyed it so much that we came back for my husband‘s birthday and tried some new things which all were a hit.",
          "Quite a surprise. Wasn't expecting much given the very generic Indian name, and unusually high ratings on Yelp and Google. However, every single dish was tasty. The service was professional and the ambience, nice.\n\n- Goat chukka dry: Mild spicy, goat was excellently cooked to the point of shredding\n- Shrimp curry leaf masala: a little bland to our liking. Could be spiced up a lot with crushed black pepper, and shallow fried onions\n- Egg dosa: nice texture, the egg is noticeable, batter felt fresh, chutneys and sambar were above average\n- Spicy Bullet Naan: generous dose of butter, soft, and tasty\n\nStreet parking can be challenging to find based on time of the day / week.\n\nOverall, works as an option to come back, but likely wouldn't go out of my way to repeat.",
          "AMAZING food, even amazing service. The hosts are so friendly, sweet and welcoming. The chicken 65 and vijaywara chicken biryani is our favourite. We have been here 5 times in 3 weeks already!!\nAlso the music here is so beautiful, full old Indian songs - reminds me of home every time."

Service is superb and quick.\n\nHighly recommend the lamb chops. 10/10\n\nSamosa is a little tough.  8/10\n\nThey gave us complementary crisp thin Indian bread as appetizer and sweet soup as dessert.\n\nRestaurant itself is very clean and nicely decorated.",
          "Very friendly staff, I have been coming here for a few years already. Food is consistently good, they have the best Butter Chicken Masala and Garlic Naan of every Indian restaurant I have tried! To the point that's now, how I measure if the food is as good at other places. Hands down, best Indian food! The location is not too busy and they stay open later than most restaurants, always a good bite, especially for dinner, when parking is easy around Geary."

          "Super yummy and filling meal! As is typical for mission burritos, you get what could honestly be two meals for the price of one.\n\nI got the California burrito with carne asada. The tortilla was excellent. The first few bites were okay but it got better midway through as I got to the cheese and the juicier meat. Unfortunately there was very little pico and avocado, but they didn’t skimp on the meat at all so I guess it balances out.\n\nThe chips and salsa were just okay. I thought I had to pay for them separately but they ended up bringing them out with my burrito anyway.\n\nThe Mexican hot chocolate was a winner. Huge size in a stylish cup. Just make sure you don’t burn your tongue so you can taste the rest of your meal! :)\n\nService was quick and easy. Pay at the counter. Credit card is fine. Music and atmosphere are great. Probably too loud if you want to have an intimate conversation but just right if you’re hoping to kick back.",
          "I absolutely loved this place. I went there for lunch on a Saturday and when I got, I was able to find a a table, but just after 15 minutes, it got filled up completely, and there was a line to get a table.\n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small and intimate, and it has a lot of very colourful decoration, which makes you feel like you in some carnival.\n\nI want to try a bunch of things. Everything was fresh and they told me that it would take up to 20 minutes to make my food, which was such a refreshing change from places that pre-cook your food. I was more than happy to wait.\n\nI got the tamales first. This was my first time having a actual tamale outside of the trader Joes frozen one, and it was so good. I was taken a bag by the beans and potatoes with the chicken filling, but it was so hot with the two salsas. Also, it was steaming hot.\n\nI also got the quesa birra as that is one of my favourite things to get, and this one was honestly above average. The taco could be Chris up better, and the feeling could be a little more generous, but the taste was on point.\n\nThe last thing I got was the papusa and again, this was my first time trying one, so I am not sure if this was a good one, but it was very tasty. It was hot and hearty went well with the pickled vegetables.\n\nThe host was so nice and welcoming and made me feel really comfortable with the menu that I was largely unfamiliar with.\n\nI will definitely be back and bring more people.",
          "Hands down the most delicious food ever. Super burritos that were giant and tacos that were absolutely beautiful.  I can't eat tortillas so I asked if I could have lettuce wrapped tacos and the happily accommodated me ! The guacamole was tasty too ! Everything was so delicious we went back and got more before heading to the airport. We might fly back just to get more food. I really want to try the jackfruit tacos."

          "Cantina Los Mayas was really good. The waiters and chef were genuinely kind, friendly, and welcoming, and the overall vibe made the experience even better. Portions are big and the prices are very budget-friendly, so it felt like great value.\n\nWe started with the ceviche—it was spicy, but super balanced with a fresh pineapple-lime flavor that made it bright and refreshing. We also ordered the queso fundido, and it was a highlight: a creamy, milky blend of cheeses with chorizo, and I loved the little candle underneath that kept it warm the whole time.\n\nFor my main dish, I got the mariscos served in a pineapple. It hit that perfect sweet-and-spicy combo, and the two roasted shrimp were honestly so delicious. I just wish it came with a few more shrimp, but overall the rest of the seafood was filling and satisfying.\n\nThe only thing I was expecting a bit more from was the salsas—I hoped for stronger flavor and more heat. That said, they were still good.\n\nAlso, the location is great and easy to find, and parking nearby was pretty easy, which made the whole night even smoother."

          "First time here, definitely not my last! Enjoyed a delicious super breakfest burrito with chips. Salsa bar provides variety and convenience. Reasonably priced, the burrito itself was $15! To top it off the staff is super friendly and respectful!",
          "The 2nd and 3rd visits were as satisfying as the 1st. We tried Taqueria Los Mayas several months ago. We ordered different dishes but both had mole which was memorable. Months later, I remembered how delicious the mole was and ordered it in the burrito bowl.\n\nThe dish was aesthetically pleasing and colorful: against the dark mole were crumbles of queso surrounded by purple pickled onions, red rice, greens, black beans, and sprinkles of sesame seeds.\n\nOn the 3rd visit, I tried the breakfast burrito. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and the potatoes were comforting. My hubby ordered the tortilla soup - fitting for a cold day - and the fish tacos, which he enjoyed very much. The fish was fresh and sauteed with a slight crisp.\n\nAlmost every dish came with tortilla chips. There's a salsa bar with 3 salsas, one green (mild), one orange with mango (mild and our favorite), and one hot.\n\nWill be back soon to have something with mole.",
          "This was our second time visiting Taquería Los Mayas, and we had a great experience. Lupita, who was working the cashier, greeted us with a big smile and made us feel very welcome from the moment we walked in. She was incredibly friendly and took the time to explain a few dishes we had never tried before, which really helped us know what to expect. She even let us sample the aguas frescas so we could choose our favorite—such a thoughtful touch.\n\nWe visited on a Tuesday, which happened to be Taco Tuesday, and we ordered four carne asada tacos, a burrito, and a panucho. Everything was absolutely delicious. We also ordered a michelada, and we highly recommend it—the mix was super tasty and well balanced.\n\nWe also appreciated how clean and well-maintained the restaurant was. Overall, we had a wonderful experience, thanks in large part to Lupita’s excellent customer service. We will definitely be coming back!"

          "When I say these are the BEST birria tacos I have EVER had I am not exaggerating. The beef was cooked perfectly and was tender and juicy. Consomme had a lovely umami and rich flavor. The salsas were made in house, cold, and refreshing. My agua fresca was definitely a bit too sweet but that’s probably how it’s supposed to be. Will absolutely be back next time I’m in the Mission district.",
          "I’m born and raised in Boston, and I thought we had some pretty decent Mexican food here, but boy was I wrong. I was visiting SF and a coworker recommended Tacos El Patron to me. I’m glad I made the journey here because I think it’s the best Mexican food I’ve ever had. I think it’s ruined my enjoyment of Mexican food at home, because now I know what I’m missing out on…I will forever compare everything I eat in MA, to this restaurant in SF.\n\nOf course, in MA we don’t have the same choice and variety as you do in CA, but still! Everything was 10x more flavorful than what I’ve had at home in Massachusetts. The portion sizes are also great - usually I’m used to having to order 2 or 3 tacos or a couple tamales to be satisfied. But just one taco or tamale here is a pretty big portion (for me at least!). The horchata was also incredible! The birria tamale is so cool - it’s a must try for sure! I also had a birria taco and a taco al pastor with carne asada - also very good choices. The salsa that comes with the chips is also very flavorful, and actually a bit spicy. Nothing too hot for me, but I was surprised because in Massachusetts the free salsa is always zero spice hahaha. What a great place - I can’t wait to come back here again on my next trip to SF."

The check was on the table as soon as we finished our plates and they checked every 2min if we had put our card. The whole service dynamic felt off.\n\nAmbiance is fun, margaritas were great.\nFish tacos were very good, the mole enchiladas lacked flavor."

          "Papito in San Francisco is a cozy, welcoming spot with a menu that balances flavor, freshness, and creativity. The overall service was attentive and friendly, making the dining experience smooth from start to finish. The staff checked in often enough to make sure everything was good, but without being overbearing, which always makes a difference.\nWhen it comes to the food, everything we tried was impressive. I had the Vegetariano, which was hearty, flavorful, and satisfying without being too heavy — a great choice for anyone looking for a tasty meat-free option. The chicken tacos were another favorite, perfectly seasoned and well-portioned, not greasy or overloaded with toppings. Their quesadillas stood out as well: they had the right amount of cheese and filling, balanced and not overly stuffed, which kept them delicious without feeling overwhelming.\nThe drinks complemented the food perfectly. The spicy mango drink had just the right kick of heat to balance the sweetness, making it super refreshing and unique. Along with a few beers, the overall mix kept the meal fun and flavorful.\nPapito does a great job of keeping things authentic yet approachable, offering a dining experience that feels both elevated and casual. Between the good service, satisfying food, and unique drink options, it’s definitely a spot worth revisiting when craving Mexican food in the city",
          "Great place to bring friends, family or even a date.  Most of the food and drinks my friends and I ordered were delicious. The only entree that I didn't enjoy was their fajitas, they were under seasoned and lacked flavor. Definitely have to order the calamari, that red sauce is soo good 😁. The Al Pastor torta was packed with flavor and the fried chicken nachos were different in a good and delicious way. Service was good, but keep in mind that the restaurant is on the small side so there may be a bit of a wait for larger parties. Definitely coming back again!"

          "Came here twice, two different times on a weekend. Always a long line. There is a long long wait. Average about an hour long. Easy set up. Pay for what you want and seat where they tell you. No seats if you ask for to go. Remember that!  You may sit with others if you are on a long table. There are some big group tables but might have to wait a bit. They do serve beer but no cocktails. Their portions are very generous. Had their regular taco carne asado. Can't image how big the super tacos are?? I love their burritos dorado style. No rice in their burritos so it doesn't make you super full. Love it! Crispy in the outside of the tortillas. Can't really ask to customize anything. Love their green spicy sauce and it's available on the table when you eat. You can buy the bottle as well. Very decent prices. Service is decent. Would come here again but can't come here when I am starving.",
          "I finally had the chance to taste what is arguably the most famous burrito in all of SF. I went close to noon on weekday, and the queue was about 15 minutes long. The line moves incredibly fast, and before I knew I was already placing my order. I got the burrito they are known for which is their carne asada super burrito. I got it toasted. You place your order at the front, and then you go inside and pay your bill, and then you wait for them to call your number. The inside of the restaurant is packed, and often you will be sharing your table with other Diners, making it a very communal form of dining. My burrito took about 10 minutes to arrive, and it was probably the best burrito I have ever eaten. It wasn’t as hefty as other burritos, given the lack of rice, which gives it volume, but the meat was so tender, the beans were so well seasoned, and the sour cream, and the guac was so creamy. This was such a satisfying burrito and also the perfect portion size for one person.\n\nI will definitely be back, but I also want to try some other burritos in the neighbourhood."

          "First time coming here and it was great. Service is fast and to the point. Its a little on the spendier side for a burrito but it's 2025 so im not mad. The chips are thicc bois and the salsa is too. Can't wait to come back and try more meat options. Also the tortillas are like... crazy good.",

          "Puerto Alegre has been around a long time and with good reason. The food is solid, service is excellent. Had the Chile Verde Pork House Special. Comes with 3 warm tortillas, beans, rice, salad and stewed pork. Everything was delicious, good portion of the pork meat. Service was really spot on, didn't have to ask for anything. The atmosphere is definitely old school Mission District. First time I ate here was in 1995, other than the prices it hasn't changed at all. Did I mention they serve big pitchers of margaritas! People go bananas here with the margaritas. When it's really busy it can be difficult getting a table. You might have to wait 30-60 minutes to be seated. Overall great experience at Puerto Alegre, I highly recommend this business",
          "The customer service is A+\n\nI personally can not agree and enjoy a meal with dogs in the booths next to me, under the tables, sitting in the doorway - it feels uncomfortable unsanitary.  The dogs were quiet except one barking one.\n\nDifferently Pet Friendly\n\nGlad I came once.\n\nI took the food to go."

          "We went here on a Friday night at 7pm and waited roughly 1hr 15mins for a table of 2.\n\nOrdered the Regular size premium Kalbijjim and it was amazing!  The portion was huge and they do not skimp out on the beef. We love that there was also stewed radish, potato, carrot and rice cakes inside. The flavour was delicious and very much worth the wait!\nThe banchan was good and free refill. Kimchi, radish not too spicy or salty. Service was fast and efficient give how busy they were.",
          "Delicious galbijjim with a modern twist and some showmanship. I always bring visitors here as it’s a great spot to have a family style meal. The galbijjim is delicious, keeping true to the classic dish while adding melted cheese on top for richness and a fire torch show for your IG story post. The banchans are good, and the other dishes are good too, but get the galbijjim to share between 2-4 people. It’s not the cheapest though so expect to spend $50 per person and potentially a wait during busy hours.",
          "I’ve gone tomorrow Daeho a bunch of time and my last trip there was really did me in.  I’m probably not going back to this location because it’s really gone downhill.  The only thing good was we were seated immediately during a Thursday night dinner.  After that everything was really lackluster.  Sure it’s hustling and bustling with people but after ordering a large kalbijim with squid and extra meat, cheese and glass noodles that should have been more than enough for 3 we waited a long time for our food.  Our side dishes came out quick along with our rice. The food didn’t come out for about 20 mins so our rice was cold by the time we started eating.  They were trying to be efficient but timing was way off.  When our kalbijjim arrived it was full of potatoes and a sad amount of meat was in our pot that should have had extra meat.  The whole dish was over sauced and salty and really not enjoyable.  I tried to flag someone down but they were all so busy hey just kept saying one minute or be back.  I gave up.  I was so disappointed that I couldn’t wait to leave.  I have been to Daeho numerous times and even to the San Mateo location.  I didn’t think it could have been so bad.  Time to move on.  Others can continue enjoying Daeho but I’ll go to other locations and restaurants who offer the same but at better quality and service.\n\nPosted the video of our meal where looks can be deceiving.  Piled high with veggies under there.  Squid rings and a few pieces of beef, no bones included."

          "We’re very excited about this place, and it didn’t disappoint!\n\nWe sat at the bar counter which you could see the kitchen, it’s kinda cool and has that chill vibes perfect for a date night.\n\nWe had beef tartare and egg soufflé as appetizers, I wish the beef tartare has a bit more acidity in it, also lacks creativity in the seasoning. Egg soufflé was pretty impressive, the spicy anchovy broth that goes with it was really good.\n\nWe ordered galbi and beef tongue as main along with rice. Meat texture was excellent, yet it would be better if there are some variations in marinate.\n\nDessert was impressive, it’s structured like a tiramisu but with korean ingredients and flavors in it, very well balanced and perfect end to the meal.\n\nService was okay, for a Michelin restaurant I expect more interactions with servers. Several servers also seemed not very knowledgable about the menu and dishes.\n\nOverall pretty good value for the quality of food, recommended!",
          "The food was amazing! We were celebrating my partner’s birthday, and the team made the experience even more special. We also have shellfish and dairy allergies, and they went above and beyond — they modified dishes and even provided us with a separate menu to fit our needs. Everything we ordered was delicious. We had the glazed short ribs, BBQ prime ribs, white rice, and the beef potstickers — all SO good! They also serve a lovely tea at the end, which was such a nice touch.\n\nAnd I have to mention — the bathroom is insane. So beautiful and such a vibe.",
          "Overall worth the hype, definitely amongst the top KBBQ spots in the US, and the price reflects the food quality and good service. Definitely love to go back and try the very popular galbi and egg soufflé\n+ Amazing food. I absolutely loved the tofu banchan, and the other 2 banchans were also quite nice. Jebi churi and kochi skewers were both flavorful and cooked to perfection. And the housemade samjang sauce was a great pairing with the grilled meat. Kimchi jjigae was tasty but a little too sour for me. And the black sesame soft serve was an incredible end to the dinner. The sundae looked simple but there were bits of chocolate, black sesame and huckleberry jam buried underneath the soft serve, making every bite super interesting and different (with minimal mess at that!)\n- All the food was mostly fatty, salty and sweet forward. It’d be great to have something fresh and/or sour to cut through. I’d absolutely recommend ordering ssam/salad and more sour kimchi to eat with the grilled meat\n+/- Decent service and atmosphere. They were quite busy so it might take a while to flag down a staff. Loved that they have hooks and cubicles to place belongings right next to your table\n= Definitely try to make a reservation, or wait like 2+ hours for a table as they are very popular"

Service and atmosphere was okay, very busy vibes around the time we ate (8PM).\n\nFood was so delicious and filling for the price! The corn cheese was so good and cheesy, it went well with everything. The kimchi fried rice was also delicious and all the ingredients came together perfectly. The BBQ combo is the best deal for the price and the meat was flavorful and tender, with an extra bowl of white rice to go with it. I would recommend ordering any of these items because they were all so tasty! We still had leftovers too.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend coming here for a cheap, tasty, late night dinner. I do wish there was some dessert on the menu though!"

Everything hit the perfect note\n\nThe Galbi-Jimm Benedict was succulent and melts in your mouth\n\nThe ricotta pancake might be the best pancakes I've tried in the city, and the Vermont maple syrup is chefs kiss\n\nBut mostly importantly, everyone is extremely friendly, amazing service",
          "Pleasant experience and very accommodating staff. The food was fantastic, filling, and reasonably priced. I strongly recommend the Korean tacos and ube latte 👌🏽",

          "It’s my first time here today, my mom and I are both very satisfied with our impromptu dinner. We ordered the Galbi Jjim in medium spicy. The portion is very generous, the standard serving already included cheese, rice cake, glass noodles, and plenty of radish-carrots-potatoes! The meat was tender and flavorful, perfectly cooked and served on a cold winter night. We had leftover for another meal. ✌🏼",
          "Genuinely excellent and a serious rival to Daeho( without the crazy wait times!). The short ribs are braised to \"fall-off-the-bone\" perfection and served in massive, bubbling portions. Comes with a standard, generous cheese topping that is torched table-side for that signature smoky, gooey finish."

          "I’m in town for a convention and came to 707 Sutter for some late night dinner. It’s a cozy little place with nice ambiance and great service. I got the Fried wings w/soy garlic and Beef dumplings. Everything was incredibly fresh and delicious, even an hour before closing. They brought this delightful appetizer platter out and it was ALL delicious! Then the dumplings were crispy but tender inside and the wings were crunchy and perfect. 10/10 loved it! 😋",
          "Overall, the food was decent and the prices felt reasonable for what you get. The bibim mandu had a lot of vegetables, so it felt light and refreshing—almost like eating a salad, which I liked. The stir-fried squid was pretty good too. I ate half there and took the rest home to turn it into fried rice, and it actually tasted even better that way.\n\nThe gamjatang hot pot, however, was a bit disappointing. Instead of sigeumchi greens, it had kimchi in it, and the broth was oddly thick and gritty because there was way too much perilla powder. The pork also had a noticeable smell, probably because it seemed to have been pre-boiled and refrigerated before serving. It almost felt like they added extra perilla powder to cover that smell.",
          "Hellllll yea! This place is great. The food is delicious the service is very friendly and pleasant. Highlight for me was the seafood pancake and the soft tofu soup 🤤. Also the soy garlic wings we loved and the corn cheese! The banchans were great too!\n\nWe stumbled on this pace while on the area and hungry and we will definitely be back!"

          "The food was great—especially the Korean BBQ, which I really enjoyed. The service was good overall, but I wish we had a bit more attention from the waiter. At one point I wanted to order more food, but the waiter wasn’t around. I’d recommend ordering everything you want right away. Still, the food itself was very good and worth it.",
          "I have visited here many times, usually when I am in the area where I am craving for some good Korean food. Most of the times when I arrive there is a wait with multiple parties ahead of me, but I do not mind since I am a very patient person. The food and service is good here, so I understand why it is always busy and packed here. You can choose to have either their Korean barbecue dishes or their traditional authentic Korean items. Their menu consists of shareable items, soups, stir fry dishes, and much more delicious items. The staffs here are welcoming, well trained and understanding where I never encountered any issues during any of my visits. If you are not in the mood in waiting then I recommend you making a reservation if available. I highly recommend this place to all Korean food enthusiasts, to all Korean barbecue lovers, or if you just want to try something new. I definitely will be back to tryout the other delicious options they have to offer."

          "Such a unique place to enjoy best class delicious Korean food & drinks with music & dance lounge vibes. I enjoyed both authentic & creative Korean dishes and lesser-known premium Korean drinks.\nSo much fun!!!",
          "The Korner Store is a private event space now. I sent an inquiry in for a Saturday night booking, and received prompt response with a quote and some options. There's a minimum food and drink amount. I coordinated a walk through of the space and made a deposit!\n\nThe hosts and owners (Ina and Nick) are incredibly helpful throughout the booking and night of the event. My ~40 guests enjoyed the Korean food and full bar. We had a fantastic time in the private space. The venue has tv screens, music inputs, DJ and dance area,  karaoke, and an optional photobooth. I highly recommend considering The Korner Store for your next event.",
          "So I was lucky enough to give this place a try during a closed event hosted by the Seoul sisters and the Hoo Lee Gans.    Pretty cool vibe and atmosphere when you walk in.  Extensive drink list and pretty skilled bartenders tend to your thirsty soul while the home cooked Korean style street food dishes caress your belly.  As it was a closed event , the food was a buffet style, help yourself and gubble it up style.  Regardless the food was spot on.  I really enjoyed the onion pancake.  This dish is as simple as it looks it is actually rather tricky to make.  The popcorn chicken was tender, the kimchi zesty yet firm and tender.\nI suggest you give it a try and work yourself through their menu."

          "After our trip to Alcatraz and an afternoon of shopping at the Wharf, we worked up quite an appetite and decided to try Piccolo Forno. The restaurant is small and cozy, and as many have mentioned, there was a bit of a wait since we arrived later in the evening, but we didn’t mind at all. The incredible aromas coming from the kitchen made it worth it.\n\nOur table ordered a great variety of dishes including pizza col salame, lasagna classica, ravioli di zucca, pappardelle al ragù, and ravioli di aragosta. For dessert, my friend enjoyed the cannolo siciliano. Overall, the food was delicious, comforting, and clearly made with care.\n\nService was friendly overall. There was a small hiccup when I was initially served the wrong dish. When I mentioned it, there was some confusion as I was told it was what I had ordered. However, my group did hear my order, and as a vegetarian, the dish I received wasn’t something I could eat. That said, this didn’t negatively affect our experience. The rest of the staff were very accommodating, and the owner handled the situation\nwonderfully, which we truly appreciated.\n\nI don’t enjoy confrontation and never want to make an issue, but I felt the way the situation was resolved spoke volumes about their professionalism and care for guests. We left full, happy, and satisfied and would absolutely return.",
          "This place was fantastic. When there are so many solid options for Italian in this area, piccolo doesn’t disappoint.\nMy wife has a pine nut allergy and they were confident in making sure she didn’t get cross contamination.\nWe got pepperoni pizza, dough is amazing. Pizza sauce is top notch. Lasagna was so good. The bolognese was what dreams are made of.\nFood was excellent service equally matched. Will totally visit again."

          "This restaurant deserves five stars–and then some. Between the dim, intimate, lighting, attentive service, and truly fabulous food, there was nothing more we could have asked for. The complimentary bread arrived warm and pillowy soft. The autumn breeze mocktail was a beautiful study in balance, with ginger delicately offset by pomegranate. The agnolotti was playful and smart; when I punctured the cheerfully green pillows of pasta, the chicken filling revealed itself – creamy, inviting, and every bit as delicious as it looked. The market fish was earthy and impeccably cooked, fresh and silky with a gorgeous char. Its tender texture was perfectly balanced by the comforting starchiness of the rice. The squid ink lobster pasta was bold, unexpected, and deeply satisfying. The affogato seemed to evaporate on the tongue, leaving behind nothing but pure flavor. Our server, Kim Thi , was animated and graceful, adding warmth and ease to an already exceptional evening. This is a place that deserves to be lavishly praised!",
          "In writing this review, my only disappointment is that I can’t give them six stars! From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed as if we were old family friends from our hostess. She gently showed us into a waiting area and showed us the previews of the menus. Less than three minutes later on a very busy Saturday night,we were seated at a very comfortable table.\n\nOnce we are seated, our wait person Dereck brought us still and sparkling water. we ordered a bottle of bubbles to start our dinner adventure.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu with us and explaining the specials, we moved onto the first course. To in our party shared the meatballs, which they raved about… My wife had the prosciutto salad, which was a very generous portion… And I had the raw fish crudo of amberjack from Hawaii. Marvelous!\n\nOur main courses were an assortment of their housemaid pastas…one pappardelle, one tagliatelle, one maccheroncelli and The squid ink pasta with lobster special. These were prepared and presented with perfection. Dereck did a wonderful job in guiding us through our dining experience.\n\nWe did score a couple of delicious desserts, one of which being a chocolate budino and the other was the bread pudding.. I had a hard time sharing the budino..It was so good.\n\nThanks to Alexis For stopping by and greeting our table.\n\nComfortable atmosphere, attentive service, some of the best pasta we’ve had this side of Italy… It’s hard to beat this. Our family was thrilled and couldn’t stop talking about it.Thanks again to all the staff, and we look forward to coming back to sample more items of your menu.",
          "My friend and I made a reservation for here, it was mid. Our waiter was nice. They informed me that I wasn’t able to modify my meal. I tried their food anyway. The presentation of the food was boring and the pasta my friend had was watery. Their lasagna has no unique flavor. How can you tell me I’m not able to modify my meal and your meal still lacks quality and flavor? If you like bland food with low vibrational energy this is the place for you. When you walk in the door you should leave an impression on your guest. This place needs to do better. How do you have an Italian restaurant with no Caesar salad?"

          "I had a great experience at this cozy Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a charmingly rustic feel, complete with a well-stocked bar and string lights that give it a homey, comfortable vibe. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter was helpful with the menu.\n\nThe real standout of the meal, and something you can tell from the photos, is the sheer size of the portions. They don't mess around! I ordered a pasta dish topped with a generous amount of fresh basil and what looked like burrata or a similar creamy cheese. My friend's spaghetti with a huge, impressive-looking meatball was also massive, and the clams in white wine sauce were abundant and delicious. You definitely get your money's worth here, and you'll likely have leftovers.\n\nFor dessert, we had a simple but delicious bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. It was the perfect way to cap off a very filling meal. I highly recommend giving this place a try."

The food is consistently delicious, the atmosphere is warm, and the service is always friendly. Highly recommended!",
          "The pasta here was excellent. I ordered the pappardelle with a white cream sauce, which was good, don’t get me wrong, but after a few bites, the heaviness of all the cheese started to weigh me down. The meat ravioli with Bolognese, on the other hand, was fantastic. The richness of the filling was perfectly balanced by the slight tartness of the tomato sauce, which cut through the heaviness beautifully. I’d love to come back to try their pesto sauce next time, it sounds like a lighter, flavorful option."

          "Fantastic experience! And considering what we have paid for other Michelin experiences, the value is here- especially for a 2-star restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nOverall, every dish hit the mark except one diner didn’t care for the Ridged Pasta (too sweet)- though this diner happily finished it for them.\n\nService was impeccable and the atmosphere was fun yet relaxing.\n\nWine pairing was on point as well with an extremely knowledgeable sommelier.\n\nOverall- just an excellent experience and well worth a visit.",
          "We came here to try out its tasting menu.  The cooking is excellent.  These dishes exceeded our expectations and left a long lasting memory to us: Wolfe ranch quail, Ridge pasta with faux four gras, Millbrook venison and Pear crema.   The restaurant environment is traditional and classy.  The service is outstanding.  I would recommend it for special occasions or you just want to enjoy a spectacular Italian dinner at San Francisco.",
          "ok TLDR super lovely vibes & main courses were BOMB but dessert and service disappointed for a 2 michelin.\n\ni’ll start w the positives.  fav dishes: the amuse bouche was so unique and i loved.  hokkaido scallop was so fresh and had a decadent sauce.  foie gras pasta is probably the best pasta ive ever had in my life.  so creamy rich and the freshest truffles.  and the quail was so tender and caramelized and idk how they made the parsnip so flavorful. crudo was also v fresh and good.  the duck caramelle was super unique and i didnt know fig could pair w pasta so well\n\ni personally wasnt super impressed w the venison.  they said medium rare but the inside wasnt warm but the flavor with the jam and stuff was actually pretty good.\n\nthe pear crema literally tasted like pear apple sauce with a cream on the outside idk not my cup of tea.  the tiny tiramisu they brought for pedros bday was infinitely better.  the bon bon cart was super fun but i tried 5 of them and they were all just bad except the black sesame caramel was fire.\n\nthe service….i actually really like a long meal but it toon them 30 mins to bring the first course which is a bit excessive.  4 hour meal for 9 courses is kinda wild like ive had 22 course meals be shorter.  ALSO i think we just got a new server but he was so nervous, stumbling over his words and we caught that he explained a lot of stuff completely wrong bc he brought out the cheese plate and after tasting them we were like uhhh whatever he said was the goat cheese was clearly the pecorino and the jams tasted nothing like what he said and after listening to the other server explain at the other table, we realized that a lot of the things he said were very different.  we laughed about it but thinking now like when ur paying $750 for a meal part of what youre paying for is the excellence of service which just wasnt there (i feel like a snob but).\n\noverall, the food is 2 michelin level but im surprised theyve kept both stars w the service we received"

          "I rarely leave negative reviews because I understand how important positive feedback is for small businesses. However, our recent experience was disappointing.\n\nThe server’s attitude felt disrespectful from the start. He questioned whether we were comfortable with the wine prices in a way that made us feel uncomfortable. He also described a special as having a “bolognese-like sauce,” but when I referred to it as “bolognese pasta,” he abruptly stated that they did not have bolognese pasta, which was confusing given his earlier description.\n\nWhat concerned me most was his behavior toward my daughter. She was quietly drawing on the back of the receipt when he took the pen from her abruptly, without asking. She was visibly embarrassed by the interaction.\n\nWe spoke with the owner, whom we like and respect, but unfortunately the experience left a negative impression. For that reason, we will not be returning."

          "Had lunch at Cotogna and ordered gelato for dessert. For the main course, we had the Agnolotti del plin and the tortilla with sunshine and rosemary—both were amazing and full of flavor.\n\nThe ambience was great and the restaurant felt kid-friendly, which was a plus. However, the service was not satisfactory for the price point. Everything took a long time, from placing the order to receiving the food, and even getting the check took about 10 minutes.\n\nIf you have ample time and don’t mind waiting, the food and atmosphere are excellent—but be prepared for slow service.",
          "This is honestly some of the best pasta I’ve ever had. Went for lunch and managed to get seats at the bar without a reservation which felt pretty lucky, since getting a table here isn’t easy. The outdoor seating is super cute. the pastas are absolutely fantastic. Service was excellent, the drinks were lovely, and the fresh salads were great. Definitely recommend this spot for a special celebration or any fancy treat-yourself meal!",
          "Cotogna is an absolute gem in San Francisco’s dining scene, a perfect balance of warmth, sophistication, and unforgettable flavor. Every dish we tried was a masterpiece, both in presentation and taste.\n\nThe prosciutto puff pastry was the perfect start, light, flaky, and beautifully balanced with the savory richness of the prosciutto. Then came the raviolo, which was pure heaven on a plate, delicate pasta filled with creamy perfection and that luscious egg yolk center that makes every bite feel indulgent.\n\nThe agnolotti pasta was another standout, with perfectly al dente pasta and a filling so flavorful and comforting it almost defies description. And the lamb pasta, wow. The depth of flavor, the tenderness of the lamb, and the subtle herbs made it one of the most memorable pasta dishes I’ve ever had.\n\nCotogna doesn’t just serve food, it creates an experience. The service was warm and professional, the atmosphere cozy yet refined, and every bite reminded us why this restaurant is so beloved.\n\nIf you love Italian cuisine done with heart, precision, and creativity, Cotogna is a must-visit."

          "Went later in the night since they close at 10pm. Nice ambiance with dim lighting. Service was pretty good.\n\nAppetizers:  I thought the complimentary bread felt nice and soft, but the gf felt it was old and cold compared to hot & buttery bread served at other restaurants. Next, the Bruschetta ca' pummarola tasted the best out of all the orders.\n\nMain: We went with the three course prix fixe meal:\n1. Swordfish Carpaccio Antipasti tasted... interesting; like salty dried fish, maybe not our taste?\n2. When the Squid Ink Fettuccine and Salmon Fettuccini came with \"a lot of plate\", the portion initially looked small, but there was actually a good amount of pasta there. But flavor for both was lacking and quite salty;  we could not finish it due to the sodium.\n3. Panna cotta - it was okay.\n\nOverall 3/5 for the food. I bookmarked this place awhile back and was glad to try it, but will likely not return.",
          "First off, the food was absolutely incredible. Every dish was bursting with flavor and beautifully prepared, easily the best Italian restaurant I’ve been to.\n\nThe service was just as impressive, if not better. Our waiter delivered true five-star service, offering complimentary tastings, making thoughtful recommendations, and striking the perfect balance of attentiveness without being overbearing.\n\nThe ambiance was a perfect blend of classy and fun, with the charm of an upscale Italian restaurant and the energy of a lively bar. They even have a free pool table, which adds a playful touch.\n\nHighly recommend. I’ll be making it a point to return to San Francisco just to dine here again.",
          "Bella Trattoria — Solid carb-load spot in SF\n\nFirst time in California—and San Francisco—as an adult. We booked a same-day reservation for a group of five at Bella Trattoria the night before my half marathon (Bay Breeze Half Marathon), specifically to carb-load.\n\nBecause it was the day before Valentine’s Day, the menu was prix fixe only—2 or 4 courses, no à la carte. I went with the 2-course option ($45), fully vegetarian:\n\nAntipasto\nTricolore — arugula, mixed greens, chopped artichokes, olives, balsamic. Fresh, simple, and did the job.\n\nEntrée\nSpaghetti all’Arrabbiata — fresh spaghetti, San Marzano D.O.P. tomato sugo, garlic, onions, shallots, Calabrian chili peppers.\nThis was the standout. I was slightly worried it’d be bland (bad pre-race pasta experiences in the past), but this had real depth and heat. Bright tomato flavor, noticeable spice, and well-seasoned throughout. Not a “blow-your-mind” dish, but very solid and exactly what I wanted before a race.\n\nFor the table, we also had complimentary garlic bread, polenta di Bella with mushrooms, and a smoked salmon pasta. The bread with tomato sauce was especially good—slightly sweet, rich, and felt authentically Italian.\n\nDessert\nChocolate pistachio gelato (excellent), and they kindly threw in a panna cotta with berries on the house. I mostly stuck to the gelato since I had a race the next morning—no need to gamble with GI issues.\n\nVerdict:\nGood food, generous service, and impressive that we snagged a late, same-day reservation. Bonus point: I placed 3rd overall and 3rd male the next day—so yes, I’m giving the pasta partial credit. 😄\n\nA dependable Italian spot in the heart of SF. Would return if I’m back in the area."

          "THE BEST RESTAURANT EVER!!!!! I couldn’t recommend more. This is by far the best Italian restaurant in San Francisco. Everything on the menu is so good and the customer service is so so so amazing. David is the best person ever and he makes you feel so at home and heard. If you are in the city you simply must go here. The best chocolate cake and tiramisu!!!!!!",
          "This Italian restaurant is easily one of the best in the Bay Area. The service was excellent from the moment we walked in, the staff is super friendly and all Italian, which adds an authentic vibe. The food arrived fast and everything tasted incredible, from the fresh bread they serve when you sit down to the main dishes with really fair prices for the quality. They also offer a great non-alcoholic white wine option for people who don’t drink but still want that dinner vibe. The place has a cozy atmosphere, amazing food quality, and overall outstanding service. I’ll definitely be coming back many times and highly recommend it."

The owner is really kind and he even gave our dog chicken as treats. It’s definitely worth trying in north beach and the atmosphere is so cozy and romantic. I like the fish and the soup, they’re fantastic Mediterranean food!!! Baklava is amazing, definitely worth trying as authentic Turkish desserts:))",
          "North Beach Gyro is a clean and cozy spot with a welcoming atmosphere. Tje dining area was well kept and clean. The staff were friendly and polite, and a special shout-out goes to our waiter, Jose, who was super friendly, kind, and genuinely attentive. His positive attitude made our experience more enjoyable and truly unforgettable.\nWe ordered several items and were very satisfied with the food quality. The feta fries were crispy and delicious, with great texture and flavor. The salmon wrap really stood out, juicy, well wrapped, and generously portioned, with no unnecessary spices overpowering the natural taste of the fish. The cilantro sauce served on the side added a fresh and flavorful touch that elevated the dish even more. The falafel wrap was also good, solid and satisfying.\nOverall, North Beach Gyro is a nice casual spot for a flavorful and filling meal, especially if you enjoy wraps done right. A bit more attention to restroom cleanliness would make the experience even better.",
          "Absolutely phenomenal! This was easily the best Mediterranean meal I’ve had in San Francisco and I’ve eaten at a lot of places. The flavors were fresh, rich, and perfectly balanced. I ordered the duck, and it was so good I didn’t leave a single crumb on the plate.\n\nThe owner was hilarious and genuinely friendly, which made the whole experience even better. You can tell he really cares about his food and his guests. The atmosphere was warm and relaxed, and the service was fast without feeling rushed.\n\nIf you’re anywhere near the area, this place is a must-try. It’s the kind of spot you leave already planning your next visit."

The staff was very kind, friendly, and attentive.\n\nWe tried the spicy hitipiti, saghanaki, horiatiki salad, beef souvlaki, and lavraki. The saghanaki stole the show - reminded me of an Argentine provoleta. Delicious melted cheese with lemon. We also loved the beef souvlaki - it was very tender, smoky, and perfectly cooked. For dessert we tried the baklavaki which was super yummy and very generous portion.\n\nVery cozy, family feeling great for all ages and occasions. Cant wait to come back!",
          "Just had an amazing meal at Milo’s! We live pretty close by but finally made the trip over and are so glad we did. The service is great and they make you feel right at home.\n\nOur server had some great recommendations for both food and wine. We got a bottle of one of the Semeli wines that was perfect for a chilly day.\n\nFor food we had the dip platter and saganski both which were phenomenal. In addition we ordered the beans and a souvlaki. Everything was delicious with tons of flavor!! We finished with a baklava that was Amazing!!! Not too sweet, loaded with walnuts and the right amount of honey.\n\nPlus the outside is dog friendly which was perfect. I can’t wait to go back!!"

          "Delicious vegan options (clearly indicated) and friendly service. I ate this gyro so quickly bc of how good it was (see second pic)I’m definitely returning for more😌",
          "Been a rough week and The Bite made sure I end it on a high note. I just ordered late night delivery for tonight's dinner, and next two days of meals. Entrées are high quality ingredients. Made fresh to order. Meat was not dried out. Lightly seasoned to enjoy the fresh natural flavor of the foods.\n\nBonus points for the careful packaging of my delivery order, especially the protective wrapping for the soups.\n\nHighly recommend!!!"

          "GET THE PITA it’s thick and chewy and buttery!\n\nCozy upscale dining. We sat at the bar. Bar seat is better than table seat. Better lighting and you can sit closer together.\n\nWaiter said bar seats you can get by calling to reserve two days in advance. Table seats you can get by calling two weeks in advance. Unless you’re a party of one - we had a person walk in and sit next to us\n\nFried cheese - waiter drizzled lemon juice and it sizzled nicely. But it cooled too quickly and became boring to eat\n\nBabaganoush - good but not the best in the city. I liked the pickled veggies that came with it though\n\nTzin spritz - ok, too much volume. I liked eating the berries. Waiter called them British boba 😂\n\nHibiscus mocktail - tart and delicious!\n\nSquash - forgettable, did not taste the pistachio butter\n\nOctopus - ok, did not come with tail\n\nChicken - yummy and enough to feed two people\n\nWe over ordered and could not finish the chicken. The waiter packed the chicken for us\n\nFood not worth the $200 total, you are  paying for the ambience. Nice place to dress up for. Would be nice to just get drinks here also. There’s a fireplace with real fire and the overall volume is not too loud, you don’t have to strain to hear.",
          "I saw other reviews recommending the appetizer lamb chops over the entrée version, and I did enjoy the appetizer one, they’re delicious, with a wonderfully crispy surface. The octopus dish is very tender, and both the whole fish and the zucchini cake are perfectly crisp on the outside. Overall, great textures and flavors!",
          "First and most important.\nThe Host was not welcoming  and had a stern demeanor.\nSecondly the atmosphere was very noisy.\nThird the food which is very crucial lacked high standards for being a San Francisco gourmet restaurant. The flavor of the food and texture was off.\nI ordered the ravioli plate it was drowned in a highly salty sauce and the ravioli was not al dente it was raw, it needed  more time. Also the tiny pieces of sweet potatoe and zucchini in it were over cooked.\nMy husband ordered the lamb chops plate, it came with 2 chops and 3 russet potatoe wedges the lamb chops were bland with no seasoning and a lemon, the potatoes were fried and dry from the inside.\nIt was disappointing to spend $160.00 dollars on the type of service and food. It did not meet my standards regarding customer service, food presentation, flavor, texture and quality."

          "It was decent.\n\nI didn't like how firm the falafel was but Boi did I enjoy the eggplants on the falafel platter - definitely worth adding it to you platter.\n\nThe House pita was.. Decent.\n\nAll in all, was a good place to be. :) super friendly staff though.",
          "I bookmarked this spot a year ago, so after a nearby walk, we finally jumped at the chance to have lunch at Mezze and Mooore!\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, we were greeted by the owner, Nabil, whose million-dollar smile sets the tone for this charming corner café. We were pleasantly surprised by the prices — especially in a time when lunch fare has climbed everywhere else.\n\nThe interior is bright and welcoming, with beautiful tiled floors and plenty of windows that fill the space with natural light.\n\nWhen we heard the mint lemonade was made in-house, we had to try it — and it did not disappoint. I ordered the falafel platter, which was generous enough for two meals. The falafel were crisp on the outside, perfectly green and flavorful inside. As a self-proclaimed hummus snob, I can say theirs was outstanding — smooth, rich, and creamy.\n\nMy friend ordered the lamb shawarma wrap and raved about how delicious it was. We finished with a piece of baklava, which was just the right amount of sweet and flaky.\n\nWe’ll definitely be back — this spot is a true gem!"

          "Authentic Turkish Flavors with a Cozy Vibe!\nLokma is an amazing spot in San Francisco for authentic Turkish and Mediterranean food. The ambience is warm, modern, and inviting — perfect for brunch or dinner. The dishes are beautifully presented and full of flavor — from the juicy kebabs to the freshly baked bread and delicious mezes. The service is attentive and friendly, and everything tastes fresh and homemade. Their Turkish coffee and desserts are a must-try! A perfect blend of great food, great service, and great atmosphere — highly recommended!",
          "I've never seen so many headless turkeys in my life. Bless that one server that is singlehandedly carrying the entire restaurant.  She must be able to deadlift 1000 lbs without breaking a sweat. I've never had it so difficult to grab a waiter's attention. No one is working????\n\nService aside, food is comforting and simple. Nothing wild. Probably not worth the price tag.\n\nOverall, my experience that day was horrible and I'm never coming back."

          "Oh my. We came here for brunch and we were pretty impressed by overall experiences including the quality of foods, service and architecture of the place.  I am not sure if this is Turkish or Greek and I am supposed to be cautious about this bc I can’t offend either one of them but regardless all of the dishes we had were delectable.\n\nWe came here for brunch and ordered Turkish flatbread, Octobus and Sujuk and baklava . I don’t think I had better baklava . It was so dreamy and melting inside of my mouth. It’s not the traditional baklava but it had perfect mixture of sweetness, texture with tanginess from raspberry.  We really loved Octopus and Sujuk as the spices with Sujuk were so unique and flavorful. My daughter loved flatbread .\n\nI recommend also getting pistachio coffee if you love pistachio and coffee.\n\nWe will definitely come back for diner !",
          "Dalida is elevated Mediterranean food and a stunning view from the outdoor patio onto presidio's tunnel tops park.\n\nI ate at the bar and got the breaking bread which includes humus, muhammara, labneh and other assortments with a pit bread baked with zaatar. A great dish for the table.\n\nAlso got the tapsi kebab that came with shoestring potatoes and egg. This was delicious and meaty, and with the runny egg yolk was 🔥. The potatoes were crisp and the kebab was like a juicy, mildly seasoned chaapli kebab.\n\nFor desert I had the chocolate hazel nut tart. Not super on brand like kunefe but this was stunning. It came with some chocolate crisps and anise ice cream. I loved this!\n\nTo finish I got the ottoman coffee which was a good Turkish coffee.\n\nThe server was super helpful and made sure we didn't over order. I think I will go back for brunch.",
          "A marvelous meal with a remarkable ambiance. I started off with oysters which were thankfully up to my expectations. The tamarind based cod entree was super smooth and silky in texture and taste and I found myself unable to stop. It was that good however the baklava with raspberry sauce felt like a culinary joke. If my dessert experience was up-to par I would’ve given it full stars. Either way I will still come back for another seasonal meal beside I love the bay! And trust me, when I say today was an absolutely beautiful day with Golden Gate Bridge my view and a delicious meal fascinating my soul to write, I am filled with gratitude and bliss."

The host and the entire staff are wonderful people who make you feel right at home. Great food, great people - we highly recommend Old Jerusalem for a top-notch dining experience!",
          "Old Jerusalem is an absolute must-visit. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, but the food is the real star of the show.\n\nHere’s what we had:\nChicken Shawarma Plate: The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender. It paired perfectly with their fluffy rice and hummus.\nLamb Chops Plate: These were the highlight of the night! Cooked perfectly - juicy, and incredibly flavorful. You can tell they use high-quality meat.\nKunafa: You cannot leave without ordering this. It arrived warm, gooey, and sweet with that signature crunchy topping. It’s easily one of the best versions of this dessert I’ve ever had."

          "We visited on a weekend evening and waited over an hour, as they do not take reservations and the space is small. It is a popular spot and still worth trying, though a less busy night may be more enjoyable. We ordered the Caesar salad and the large cioppino. The Caesar was a generous portion for two and overall good, though the dressing was lighter than expected. The croutons were excellent and easily the standout of the salad. The large cioppino was the highlight. The broth looked tomato based but leaned more toward spiced flavors than tomato. It was filled with crab, crab legs, shrimp, fish, clams, and mussels, all well prepared, and bibs were provided since it can get messy. Overall, Anchor Oyster Bar is worth a visit, especially if you can go on a quieter night to avoid the long wait.",
          "We finally arrived at this cozy, welcoming, and authentic restaurant. There were a lot of people there, but we were the first. Everyone waited patiently, and it was worth it. The food was delicious, everything was fresh, and perfectly prepared. The oyster selection was excellent. The staff was incredibly polite and attentive. It was a great day.",
          "Went at 2:15 on a Saturday afternoon. No wait when we showed up, but a line up formed around 2:30.\nThe food was unbelievable. Had a dozen oysters and the full size cioppino. The cioppino was outstanding, very large dish my wife and split. Absolutely worth the hype and any wait a person chooses to do.\nThe service was great, super friendly. We brought a bottle of champagne for corkage, and some places are miffed when you bring a bottle in, they were happy and very accommodating and brought an ice bucket to place it in.\nShort review is definitely recommended."

          "Scoma’s Restaurant absolutely lives up to its reputation. From the moment you walk in, it feels like a true San Francisco classic warm, welcoming, and effortlessly charming. It’s the kind of place that reminds you why certain restaurants stand the test of time.\n\nThe food was outstanding. Everything tasted incredibly fresh, especially the seafood, which was prepared perfectly and full of flavor. You can tell quality and care go into every dish, and nothing felt rushed or overlooked. This is seafood done right simple, elevated, and memorable.\n\nWhat truly set Scoma’s apart, though, was the service. Hands down, it was the best service I’ve experienced since moving to San Francisco. Attentive without being intrusive, knowledgeable, and genuinely kind it made the entire dining experience feel special and relaxed.\n\nThe atmosphere adds to the magic. Classic yet comfortable, lively but never overwhelming, it’s an ideal spot whether you’re celebrating something special or just enjoying a great meal out. Everything flows seamlessly, which is a testament to how well this place is run.\n\nI’ll definitely be back, and it’s a place I’ll happily recommend to anyone looking for an unforgettable dining experience in San Francisco.",
          "This restaurant is PHENOMENAL. Came here for date night with my boyfriend and it was all around such an enjoyable experience. Make sure to get a reservation beforehand, as they can get pretty busy. The food here was amazing, it was all so flavorful and just delicious. My boyfriend got a steak dish and he said the cut of meat was really high quality and that it was cooked to perfection. I got the clam linguine and it was also amazing. Finally the service here is just amazing, all the waiters are extremely kind and respectful. I will be coming back once I am back in SF!",
          "We had a really enjoyable experience at Scoma’s Restaurant, and I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking for a special meal on the water in the San Francisco Bay Area. The location right on the bay gives you great views and a relaxing atmosphere, which sets the tone for a memorable dinner. The space feels open and inviting, perfect for sitting back with a drink and appreciating the scenery while you wait for your food.  ￼\n\nWe tried a few different dishes during our visit. The steak was excellent — cooked just right, flavorful, and rich. It’s the kind of dish you hope for at a waterfront restaurant, and it definitely delivered. The seafood soup was also very good, with generous portions and fresh ingredients that gave it depth and authenticity. The risotto was decent, creamy and satisfying, though not as standout as the steak. The pasta, on the other hand, was fairly ordinary — enjoyable but nothing compared to the other dishes we ordered. Overall the food quality leaned toward the higher side, especially considering the location.  ￼\n\nOne of the highlights of the evening was the drinks — both the wine and cocktails were tasty and nicely poured, which paired well with the food and setting. Be prepared that this place isn’t cheap; it’s definitely more on the upscale side in terms of pricing, but for a special night out or a celebratory dinner, it’s worth it.\n\nThe service was pretty good, attentive without being intrusive, and the staff seemed experienced and confident. They helped guide us through the menu and made solid suggestions based on our preferences, which made the ordering process smoother. In summary, if you’re looking for great steak, solid seafood options, good drinks, and a lovely waterfront environment, this restaurant is a strong choice — even if a few dishes like the pasta don’t quite reach the same level. Highly recommended for a scenic and satisfying meal in the Bay Area!"

          "Delicious seafood. We came around 10am and we had to wait 3 hours to be seated. The raw oysters, Sicilian sashimi and cracked crab are worth trying. Service was great!",
          "There’s a reason this spot is Anthony Bourdain’s favorite spot in SF. It’s pretty straightforward good seafood spot that serves fresh catch! It can get a little pricey but the coziness of the place and the attentiveness of the staff makes it worthwhile.\n\nI specifically liked the sashimi platter and the oysters they have are flavorful, briney and fresh — we had it for breakfast and didn’t have any tummy issues!\n\nNote though they serve Boston style clam chowder so it’s runnier than the typical chowder you find in SF",
          "Stepping into Swan Oyster Depot is like stepping back in time to a place that has perfected the art of fresh seafood. This is a no-frills, counter-seating-only institution, and its charm is in its authenticity and, of course, its incredible food.\n\nThe menu is a dream for any seafood lover. We ordered the combination seafood salad (often called the Sicilian Sashimi), and it was a stunning plate of fresh-off-the-boat tuna, salmon, and white fish, perfectly accented with olive oil, capers, and a squeeze of lemon. The smoked salmon was equally amazing—buttery, delicate, and served with fantastic sourdough bread.\n\nThe guys behind the counter are true professionals, shucking oysters and preparing plates with incredible speed and skill. The atmosphere is loud, busy, and full of happy customers. It's more than a meal; it's a true San Francisco experience.\n\nEssential Tips:\n\n• CASH ONLY! The sign in the window isn't joking.\n• Arrive early (even before they open) to get a spot in line.\n• Be prepared to stand, but know that the reward is one of the best seafood meals you'll ever have."

          "This is a great place for seafood in SF. There was a short line at dinner time but it moved fast. I personally like that they don’t really take reservations. The oysters are tasty and fresh. The wines we had were delicious. Service was friendly and attentive the entire evening. The server even washed the abalone shell that the ceviche was served in for me to take home. The location is fantastic. It doesn’t get much better than waterfront dining along the bay.",

But the mussels were the real highlight: the sauce they come in is unbelievably good. We ordered bread and butter on the side, which made it even better.\n\nI also highly recommend the house-made shrub drink — it reminded me a bit of kombucha, refreshing and full of flavor.\nOverall, this place exceeded all expectations. I’m genuinely impressed and would come back anytime."

Crispy batter and juicy fish. The included chips are seasoned perfectly!\n\nOverall, I want to try them again and enjoy the atmosphere :)",
          "Hook Fish Co is a very good place to eat a good fish and chip with excellent fries that are well done and seasoned. The wating time is about 20-40 min on rush hours but is is worth it. There is limited parking in front of the restaurant so you will need to find street parking. There are only outside seating that is good. On the menu we highly recomend the fish and chips and the burrito. In conclusion we will definitely come back.",
          "Hook Fish absolutely lives up to the hype. We ordered the ceviche and chips, poke and chips, poke tacos, and grilled fish tacos—and everything was sooooo fresh and incredibly delicious. This is the kind of seafood that tastes clean, bright, and straight from the ocean.\nThe restaurant is entirely outdoors and super charming, with quirky tables, tons of plants, and a laid-back neighborhood feel. It was a beautiful saturday, which made it the perfect setting to sit outside and enjoy fresh seafood for lunch. It’s counter service, but they do have beer and wine, which is a nice bonus.\nThat said, this place was absolutely slammed. Seating was tough to come by, and since it’s counter service, you’re on your own to find a spot. We ended up eating the ceviche and poke with chips while standing (no photo because we were starving), but honestly, it was still totally worth it. One small downside was that our food came out in chunks (20 mins apart) since my friend and I ordered separately, which was a bit of a bummer.\nStill, the food is so good that it’s easy to see why this place is always packed. A little patience is required, but the freshness and flavor make it more than worth it. I’d happily go back—ideally with a little more time and luck snagging a table."

          "Cioppino is my favorite dish and I order it every chance I get. This one is hands down the BEST I've had in San Francisco. This place is consistent with their dishes and never fail. The calamari was not too greasy and perfect to the crisp. I always enjoy introducing friends to this spot!",
          "Absolutely love this place. My wife and I found this hidden gem last summer on a weekend trip to SF. So when I was in town one night for business, we made a drive intro eh city for a great dinner before our flight.\n\nLucky for us it was a rainy Tuesday night and we didn’t have to wait for a table.  The service here is so good! They had fresh bread (and I mean piping hot fresh sourdough straight out of the oven) on the table in a couple minutes.\n\nI had the clam chowder and it was so friggin good! Amazing taste and chuck of clams spread out in almost every bite. Then I ordered the same thing I got last time, linguine with seafood 🍤 🍣! The pasta is done of the best homemade pasta I’ve ever eaten. They literally pack this full of clams, mussels, calamari and a giant scallop and shrimp. I love that they don’t scrimp on the seafood.\n\nDefinitely a hidden secret but my first choice for authentic Italian In little Italy 🇮🇹!",
          "This visit was unfortunately very disappointing.\n\nWe ordered two lemonades, but both were undrinkable from the first sip. They had a strong tap-water taste, along with what seemed like poorly filtered or contaminated ice, so we were unable to finish them.\n\nThe pasta and ravioli were noticeably overcooked and kept breaking apart on the plate, which made them unpleasant to eat. The biggest disappointment, however, was the cioppino, which is advertised as the restaurant’s signature dish. The broth had the same unusual watery taste, several clams were not properly cleaned, and the seafood overall did not taste fresh—especially disappointing for a seafood restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nFor two people, ordering two pasta dishes and drinks (without alcohol), the bill came to over $140. Given the quality of the food and drinks, this felt significantly overpriced.\n\nWe chose this restaurant because it is often recommended as a well-known spot in San Francisco and expected much better. However, despite it being a Saturday lunchtime, the restaurant was already quite empty. We also noticed that all nearby tables were filled with tourists and no locals, which gave us the impression that the restaurant’s quality may have declined over time—possibly due to changes in ownership or kitchen staff.\n\nOverall, this experience did not meet expectations, and unfortunately, it is not a place we would choose to return to."

          "Such amazing Italian food!! Ordered a half dozen of east + west oysters. I personally prefer east cuz it’s sweater. Absolutely favorite is the seafood risotto, so much seafood and fresh. Same with their signature seafood soup(?) forgot the actual name of the dish. But it’s served with so much fresh seafood. Crab, shell, squid, mussel. Seasoning is absolutely spot on. Not too heavy or creamy. Such delicious food for amazing price! Def a 10/10!! Server was so nice. Just be aware they have added a 4% service fee. I didn’t take it out because I feel they deserve that and to better survive in sf as such an amazing Italian restaurant.",
          "Located in the heart of Little Italy, North Beach San Francisco.  This is my favorite place for classic cioppino, fresh oysters and marinated Dungeness crab!  They offer raw oysters either on the half shell or as shooters, west coast or east coast species with a spicy red sauce.  Be sure to ask for their fresh horseradish.   For starters, we also love their bay shrimp Louie salad, which is big enough to share with 2-3 people.  I also recommend their marinaded, cold whole Dungeness crab, which comes in an olive oil, lemon garlic sauce.  Be sure to order their marinaded”Best Damn Cioppino” , which is served in a large bowl:  Dungeness crab, mussels, clams, squid, and scallops.",
          "Such a local gem! Our good friend took us here for my partners and i's pre engagement lunch! We got the signature crab seafood soup and tye risotto and omg, was it heavenly! My partner also tried some oysters. You can tell the quality of the seafood in one bite! I highly recommend going there for small or moderate size groups but I think they have a banquet space in the basement."

          "We ordered the Seared Ahi tuna sandwich ($20) and the happy hour Original Ahi poke ($10), it was so good I couldn't take a picture fast enough before it was eaten. Absolutely amazing service, they checked on us a few times throughout our meal to make sure everything was good, and he was very helpful. Blown away by our experience and can't wait to come back",
          "I was really excited to try this location. I've eaten at Pacific catch on 9th once before and wasn't impressed. But I came with an open mind and an empty stomach.\nI ordered the poke duo, the presentation was beautiful. I love that there was a little bit of everything. Unfortunately as I dug in I noticed the poke was not very edible. The connective tissue was not removed and was very chewy, getting stuck in my teeth with every bite.\nAnd the \"fresh greens\" were not so fresh. They were about a week past fresh.\nThere were quite a few people working but every time someone came through the door customers had to search for an employee to help them.\nAt least I gave them another chance. Now I know for sure what to expect."

          "We came here for their Valentine’s Day dinner prix fixe menu. It was $265 a person. We also got the caviar service for $140. I want to start off by saying that our experience started out great. Most of our dishes were phenomenal and probably one of the best meals we have had. There were a few downsides which I will list below, but I don’t want that to take away from the good potion of our experience, which is why I only took one star away. Keep in mind that this is a hefty spend, but could be worth it.\nOur dinner started out great, waiter was attentive and had suggestions we really liked for drinks, we started with the caviar service which was bites of banana bread with a spread that I think was also banana flavored. The idea was to eat the caviar on the little bread bite with the cheese spread, I think all of the ingredients were great on their own, caviar was great, and bread bites were great with the spread as well, but together the banana flavor took away from the caviar taste in my opinion.\nMoving on to the courses, the salad that was on the menu was bitter which was fine but it just not what you would expect from a restaurant in this caliper, the lobster risotto was good but lacked some flavor. The rest of the dishes were pretty phenomenal, the steak may have been one of the best steaks I’ve had, the down side was that we waited 30-40 minutes to get our final entree (the steak and potato) before the dessert. All tables around us had gotten theirs and were already done. Within this waiting period, the waiter didn’t check in at all and we had no drinks or food for that 30-40 minute period.\nDinner started at 8:30 and we left around 11pm, that’s how long it took.\nOutside of that I still think it was one of the best meals we have had and would recommend. I just wish we left with an exceptional experience after spending $900+ for two people.",
          "Really enjoyed the food and dinner experience here. The service was outstanding.\n\nWe opted for the tasting menu where the food was chosen by chef, each course arriving was a nice surprise!\n\nThe oysters were nice and fresh, the scallops were massive and tasty. The other dishes were equally tasty and well cooked.\n\nUnsurprisingly there is a very comprehensive wine list. We had a couple of bottles of Californian white selected by the sommelier, both were really good.",
          "Angler is an awesome spot for seafood in SF. Everything tastes super fresh, and the flavors really pop. The oysters are especially good—some of the best I’ve had. Even the non-seafood items, like the bread with butter and the salad, are surprisingly tasty.\n\nThe dishes are creative but still let the seafood shine, which I really appreciate. Service is excellent—friendly, attentive, and never stuffy.\n\nIt’s definitely a high-end restaurant, but the vibe isn’t overly formal. You can relax, enjoy your meal, and just have a really good time. If you love seafood, this place is absolutely worth checking out."

          "Early January 2026 Authentic Italian deli and general store that serves both cold and warm meals and handmade sandwiches 🥪 😋 👌 as well as serves other food provisions, while offering a wide range of regional products.\n\nTucked in one of the streets near Van Ness is a more than 10 year establishment with a varied and well displayed set menu deli combining fresh and well choice cuts of meats.  The adjoining store offers the visitors ample alternatives for gourmet and European products including the alcohol.\n\nSandwiches and pizzas are served in generous and well balanced portions.  Desserts 🍨 🥧 🍦are also available at the goods section.\n\nWe were fortunate to share a few moments with the kind owner while waiting for our order.   The service was quick and our takeaways were well packaged.\n\nThe interiors and displays are reminiscent of European delis.  Bright, colorful, tasteful, and beautifully stocked.  The elevated deli with a small counter provides a wonderful perched to wait or enjoy your meal.  Al fresco tables also outside can be used during fair weather.\n\nMuch care and attention is evident in how much the establishment has been maintained which is a gem 💎 of a place ✨️ within its neighborhood\n\nIdeal for quick bites, takeaways and very small groups or dates.  All around the general store is also a great place to shop for supplies and provisions.",
          "Great sandwiches! The portions are huge and the ingredients are high-quality. The prices are very reasonable, and I think it’s a great value for the money. The sides in the sandwich are very flavorful, and there’s a generous amount of meat. However, the bread is on the firmer side, so you might want to consider that if you prefer soft bread. The shop is well-organized, and the staff are all very enthusiastic. Definitely worth a second visit!",
          "Was exploring Union Square area when I found this cute, not-so-little Italian Bakery.\n\nI had 2 hours to kill before my dinner so dived in for a quick bite here. The menu had good selection of s'wiches, Pastas (pre-made) and some Salad. I went for their no.17 (Grilled Chicken sandwich). Came out fairly quick and was good though I wish it had a bit more flavor to it.\n\nIt's a good little mini-mart of Italian food products - perfect if you're craving Italian & want to grab a quick meal."

          "If this place hadn’t used miracle whip, the sub I ordered would’ve been incredible. Instead, it was covered with it and really killed the vibe.\n\nIn general, the service was great and the customers in the shop mentioned visiting for years. Unfortunately it just wasn’t for me.",
          "My boyfriend was craving a sandwich, so I looked up a few spots and decided to give this place a try — and I’m so glad we did! It’s a small space but super efficient and well-run.\n\nWe ordered two subs, and they were absolutely amazing. I had the avocado with turkey, and my boyfriend went with the pastrami. Both were fresh, flavorful, and packed just right. We devoured our subs — definitely hit the spot!\n\nGreat little gem for a satisfying sandwich fix.",
          "One of the best subs I’ve ever had! The pastrami, Swiss, bacon, and avocado is simply incredible. The staff recommended it as it was my first time there.\nSandwich was incredible. Perfectly cooked pastrami, delectable bacon, huge chunks of avocado, melting Swiss cheese, balanced mustard, and topped with a crispy bun toasted to perfection.\nI want to go back and get this again.\nA+ will be back."

          "I can’t say enough positive things about Q’s Sandwich Shop. Beyond making incredible sandwiches (my favorite is definitely the turkey pesto, but I’ve learned you can’t go wrong and they are happy to make recommendations!), they offer wonderful service - the owner will always greet you with a smile, knows his regulars, and makes sure to pay every person who comes by special attention. This place should be on the SF best sandwich list radar - no question. They are also always innovating - trying out new sandwich ideas and new sides, so every time you go back, you can discover something new!\n\nAdmittedly, I’ve been coming here for years, but I always eat my sandwiches so quickly that I forget to take a picture…\nLove this place.",
          "Great little sandwich shop. I had the roast beef and split it with my husband. They were nice enough to cut it in half and serve it in two separate baskets, which was a thoughtful touch. The sandwich was very flavorful and delicious. I honestly was not expecting much from a simple sandwich place, but this far exceeded my expectations.",
          "Wandered by and was drawn in by the aroma. Ordered the special written on the calk board because it was a bolognese grilled cheese and OF COURSE I’m going to order that. Oh…..mygod….that sandwich was a pleasure tour for my mouth. The sauce was so savory and meaty. The bread buttery and toasty with parsley and everything delicious. And chips?? What? Yes, chips, and they were perfect. What a treat to have happened upon this place."

So worth the visit!\n\nYou can call and order by phone to pick up which I did and it saved me waiting time!\n\nWill return to try other options!\n\nUpdated: I’m now an avid customer of this sandwich shop. The owner's thoughtful and funny personality also his creativity to make the best sandwich fill me with joy every time I swing by. This store is not close to my place but I’m willing to travel far for the owner’s creation! Not to mention with the sandwich is packed with fillings. My mom and I were so full after finishing only half of the sandwich!",

          "The sandwiches were amazing! The cost of the portion sizes are insanely good. It’s a cash only place but definitely worth having. I had the pork sandwich & it was fantastic 😋",
          "It's cash only, so make sure to have that before coming. There's a few ATMs that are nearby, if you didn't know like I did. This is probably one of my favorite banh mi sandwiches that I've ever had. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it had a small line going outside of the restaurant, which is usually a pretty good sign the place has good food. Sort of a sketchy area. The line moved pretty quickly. I heard people ordering a  combination sandwich and was intrigued by that, but I decided to just keep with a pork sandwich. The bread was soft and crispy, and I think they made it right in the back! The ingredients were very fresh too. It had everything I look for in a banh mi sandwich. The ingredients were very fresh, and the jalapeños gave me a good punch across the face. The sauce really complimented the pork too, and crunchiness from the carrots is always great. Last but definitely not least, the value is crazy. It is such a good deal for a sandwich this good to be less than 8 dollars. I'd eat these far too often if I lived nearby. I see why the Infatuation holds this place in high praise.",
          "Best Vietnamese sandwich in San Francisco! The sandwiches are not as good as the San Jose one, but in term of the prices, quality of bread and the portions, it’s worth to give it a try even though it’s located in Tenderloin. Combo and pork are just ok. Chicken is the best. The bread is fresh. I like how soft it’s, not too hard as others. Cash only. Open at 7am.\nBe cautious to be there because there are many homeless around."

          "Food was not bad...maybe i dont usually have this style...I think if you like more meaty tastes ..you will like it. I like a more balanced sandwich. Egg sandwich was a no frills type of sandwich. Service was nice and small eating area...we were treated well.",
          "It's a heavy lift to live up to one's childhood memories of having a muffuletta in New Orleans - taken there by my own Sicilian family, but Sandy does so and improves on it. Starting with the most important thing, the sandwich (I had 1 slice of the Meat version with a side of slaw and chips). the meat and cheese is  layered neatly and generously, the paste and juices are flavorful without being overwhelming, and the bread is the major improvement having put it through a press it is lightly crisp on the top keeping it a reasonable thickness for even the most modest mouth.\n\nThe service was friendly, accommodating and passionate about their product. You feel welcome.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple, unique and cozy. Less hole in the wall and more a comfortable spot to sit and enjoy. Unique stickers, flags, and the like give you a sense of the roots of those working there.\n\nI noticed they sell to-go versions neatly boxed up - more stylish cannoli box than a pizza carton. I am scheming on a chance to buy a full sandwich for a party or anything.\n\nMy only want is a second shop further south on the peninsula so it'd be easy for me to eat at Sandy's regularly."

          "The Mick and the Rach are my solid go to's.   Never had a bad sandwhich and the line is worth the wait!     Beats Ike's , he even was there eating on my latest trip into the city for great food!\n\nAnother trip has me trying the Bradley! Amazing these guys dont miss!   Love this place!",
          "The 49er is the best sandwich I've had in SF. Sooo delicious! One caveat is that it's a 1/2 sandwich cut in half, pretty much 6 inches. All the photos make the sandwiches look like they're stuffed with meat, and they are stuffed in the middle, but the ends are basically bare. I would need two of these to be satisfied, so it ends up being a $60 lunch after a drink and a tip. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Would I do it regularly? Probably not, but the line is down the block so they can charge what they want!\n\nI like that you have to show up - no online or phone orders, keeps it moving. Staff was friendly and efficient.\n\nAlso had the breakfast sandwich. Definitely one of the best around except for the Dutch crunch. Just a horrible bread choice. After a few bites I actually picked the bread off and ate the majority without bread. Next time will go with sweet french and omit the bacon. However, at $21 and no possibility of ordering before 11am, not sure I'd bother in the future.\n\nI really like the counter service atmosphere, but wish they'd clear off the benches and standing tables in the windows so you could enjoy your sandwich on-site. Having to immediately leave and find a place to sit down nearby is difficult unless you don't mind the smell of urine while you eat."

There is a chill vibe in the store that makes it ideal if you need something quick.\nNegatives: they close around 9:30 which is a little early but not much of an issue\nPositives: friendly and welcoming clean store and good selection of products."

          "This is the first time I've captured photos of all food items for a review. Normally, I don't hold out on the grub down. This was a late night order (after midnight) — so I wasn't expecting to receive their best work. I am blown away by the freshness, quality ingredients, and careful preparation of the food received. Let's keep it real, when ordering food so late I come across end-of-day stragglers that sat awhile, dried out, becoming stale, and quickly thrown together before closing. The food I received from Bite was made to order, and the rotisserie chicken was fresh (did I already mention this was after midnight!?). Bite won another customer for life! Thank you for serving hearty and nutritious food of this quality, especially for night owls. Keep these folks in business!!!",
          "Ordered a recommendation from the employee behind the counter, it was a good sandwich with plenty of fillings, slightly over sauced hence the 4 stars. Prices are in line with other deli sandwich shops. Whilst visiting the shop wasn’t busy and the sandwich didn’t take too long to make. Would recommend if you need a quick bite after touring SF",
          "I was staying at Hotel Julian next door and fell in love with this place! The girls were so sweet and made the best sandwiches and wraps. The Cuban should be permanently on the menu! It was delicious. The California Hillbilly was phenomenal as well with a little kick. I had that with spinach tortilla. The cookie, pickle, potato salad, and humous were all amazing as well. Highly recommend!"

          "Really outstanding gelato that essentially taste like the European version I live. It’s very hard to find good gelato in the states but Philmore comes very close. The salted caramel is particularly wonderful as well as the pistachio. They are generous with their scoops and prices are reasonable unlike my experience with salt and straw where I paid for the “kitchen sink” for $16 and got three tiny half scoops of ice cream!! This is a hundred times better!!!",
          "Quality ice cream and great flavors- signed up for their rewards program and will be coming back! They let you try samples. Run if you want the strawberry shortcake flavor bc I was told it’ll be gone soon. Went with a friend and we both got a small cup with half matcha blackberry and half strawberry shortcake. Surprisingly, I liked the strawberry shortcake the best though both were good.\nThe insides are small and though there’s some seating inside, there’s not much so be prepared to take your ice cream for a walk."

The staff let us tried a couple flavors and all of them were really impressive. They were like juice burst in your mouth. The price was also very good. We were able to get three flavors with the medium cup and he gave us a decent amount. I would definitely recommend trying the pandan leaf and mangosteen. And I can’t wait to come back to try more.",
          "We’ve been here about four times and everytime the staff is sooooo genuinely nice and helpful. I always love the black sesame, taro, pandan, and coffee. Tried the mangosteen for the first time and it was great after a heavy dinner!! Flavors are all good and made with fresh ingredients. The best part is their staff though, they always have a big smile from the moment you walk in and recommend flavors that you may like or want samples. When talking to friends they say the same thing about their customer service and how above and beyond they always go with such great energy. I wish i could rate them higher than 5 stars!!!",
          "My fiance and I love this since we were growing up. Some of the best ice cream you have and tons of asian flavors like Guava, thai tea, red bean or durian. If you are not from SF and you want to see where locals come for ice cream, this is literally it. Get some ice cream and stroll down the beach and enjoy the sunset. It'll make you want to buy a whole tub to bring home. This is worth it."

          "The best ice cream I've had. The creaminess and smoothness of it all is next to none. Unlike other ice cream varietals, store bought or not, thejr ice cream does not ice out when put in the freezer because of it's fat content. The place is popular enough that they use a ticketing system. You should ignore any line you see and grab a ticket expeditiously. I've tried most of their flavors and I can tell you, their rum raisin is supreme. It's made with two rums. Their lychee is amazing too but I could just be a harlot for lychee. The avocado is novel and amazing to eat in-person. Getting a gallon of it loses a significant amount of the strong avocado flavor found in the fresh version. None of the other flavors I've tried have experience this. Their gallons are strong but the the kids are prone to break by the time you're about 90% done with them. The place has a stickiness to it but they do actually clean it so it's probably a mental stickiness. They're really patient with you as you try all of their flavors and the workers are pretty straightforward with you too about hand-scopped vs. pre-scooped. Honestly, the only thing I would get hand-scooped now is probably the avocado if the batch you just tasted was good.",
          "Mitchell's is in my top three for ice cream brands/spots. They somehow make the perfect ube ice cream (for my tastes). It's not too sweetened that it overbears the taste of the yam, but not too bland, and with the right milkiness. I think there are actual ube bits in it, too. That's the flavor I've been getting ever since I first came, because it is just so good. What's even better is being able to take tubs of this stuff home. It's the best. They don't just offer ice cream, but also halo-halo, sundaes, floats, other treats and sweets. Their menu is so varied and even has vegan options!\n\nThe only issue I see with Mitchell's is its limited space. There's hardly any room to stand during busy hours, both outside and inside, and there's no real seating. I guess it adds to its charm, though. Overall, 4/5.",
          "I loved that they have parking in the back because that’s a huge deal in SF. Their flavors are very unique, I tried the Thai tea which was amazing as was the espresso toffee crunch. My wife really liked their chocolate caramel crunch flavor too. I was excited to try their ube but unfortunately I sampled it and tasted pretty much no ube flavor it was just purple lol. But I’d def recommend Mitchell’s for anybody that wants good ice cream in the area or wants to switch up from the usual flavors"

I think the value is decent and it was definitely a lot of ice cream for a me.\n\nGot to sample a ton of flavors that were very interesting, including: Strawberry Honey Balsamic, Goat Cheese Marionberry Habanero, and pickled cucumber Sorbet.\n\nIt was kinda dirty in this area (streets/sidewalk) and also dirty inside (tables and floors). But it seemed clean behind the counter, so I wasn’t worried about the ice cream being contaminated.",
          "We love this ice cream place not just because of their delicious flavors. They always have, or because of the monthly new flavors that they cook up all the time. But we also love it because they always have vegan options. We don’t do well with dairy, so we’re always willing to take dairy pills to have these delicious flavors. But we also love that they are vegan flavors are also high-quality! It’s nothing fancy, it’s just ice cream. But they do it very well.",
          "I had one scoop of the goat cheese berry habanero and the coffee and nuts (half half). They were good. Not overly sweet at all. I also tried (sample) olive oil and pear blue cheese. They were good but not distinct flavors for the names. Def come back. Love it. Have outdoor seating. Perfect for a warm sunny day."

          "Ice cream is a whole experience for us, not just a scoop.  The Salt and Straw staff is friendly and concerned with fixing glitches….but management isn’t.  That’s why you’re reading this review.  I reached out to avoid talking about our repetitive ripoffs in purchasing the pints of Salt and Straw at 3 locations:  Hayes Street, Fillmore Street, and Burlingame Avenue.  Since the same problem has been pervasive from November 2024 through October 2025, we’ve concluded it’s an operational problem with packing.  The quality oversite sucks.  Here’s the story:  we’re an ice cream group, who loves Salt and Straw.  I met the founder at the Ferry Building years ago, and became ultra impressed in the youth business model.  I’ve promoted Salt and Straw countless times.  Our ice cream group meets monthly and has fun with “tastings”.  Our family also has pints in the freezer because we’re hooked on some of the vegan selections.  In our group, We always have 2 Salt and Straw flavors.  Our surprise discovery each month was finding a huge gap, hole, whatever you want to call it in the pint.  The ice cream is not packed to full density.  And in some cases, no wonder it felt half empty because it was…in the middle.  What a ripoff.  Our group finally moved on.  Suggest Salt and Straw gets some packing training from Bi-Rite and others.  It was even clear that one of our containers had melted ice cream that had reformed.\nWhen I dropped by Fillmore street a couple weeks ago to let them know this long-term issue, our hope was that they’d listen and be thankful for the heads up.  Plus, correct the situation.  Then, we….and subsequently others, could return for pints.  The manager did reach out and ask what date and time (singular) we had the problem.  Whatta joke.  Was this AI ?  We’ve sent  “Charlie” two emails since.  No response.  Who wants to in effect pay double the price for a fraud pint of ice cream that is only half that, in several cases.  Stick with the single scoops that are assembled nicely by the hardworking, enthusiastic,  front-line employees."

          "I stopped in on a Monday evening for the Miracle pop-up and had such a great experience. I hadn’t been to this bar before, but the staff made me feel welcome right away — friendly, attentive, and honestly superior service. The cocktails were creative and really well made, and even though I came alone, I felt completely comfortable and taken care of. Such a fun spot with great energy. I’m so glad I checked it out and would definitely come back!",
          "What a beautiful bar - bumping on a Saturday night. My favorite thing is the beautiful gated front patio seating, on both sides, there’s seating for groups and or small groups. The don’t patio is surrounded by living plant walls, which is gorgeous! Inside is very lovely but depending on what your scene is, it can be too crowded. The 3 of us enjoyed the fresh air and gated front patio. Fun crafted drinks and attentive service."

Very friendly stuff.\nI can recommend to come before the rush like around 9pm. It’s easy to spent there 3-4h."

          "This is a beautiful rooftop bar with beautiful views of San Francisco. I ordered a drink and it was really good. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere felt calm and comfortable. The chips were a bit overpriced but the dip was good.",
          "Best rooftop of SF, and don’t say this lightly, I have been here for 10 years.! It is really the only one with real 360 degree views. It’s spacious and really well set up. Decor section is a bit old but I’ll say that’s part of the charm.\nService is great. Max was hilarious and super helpful. Made us remember what good American service used to be.\nGood drink selection (very reasonable prices for SF, specially if you go by the bottle!) and not crowded\nWill be back and really enjoyed it.",
          "General vibe isn’t bad for a first time experience. They did play random hip hop music that didn’t seem very fitting for this kind of setting. Only got 2 things and for $60 in total, isn’t worth it. The drink didn’t hit at all, not even a buzz and I’m a lightweight. $35 for 3 slices of cheese and meat and stiff bread is crazy work. Mind you, in my photo we had barely started picking at it. I’m looking back at another person’s photo of the charcuterie board in previous reviews, and it definitely did not look the same as what I received. No one was attentive the entire time we were at our table. We had to ask some random worker, not even sure if he was a server, to give us our bill which he also had the audacity to ask for us to leave a tip. But why tip when the bare minimum and expectations weren’t met and literally no one worked for it. There was minimal interaction with any employees so I’m not sure what’s there to tip for. I would only recommend to stop by just for the view cause that’s the only selling point. Other than that, don’t bother wasting your money on food or drinks."

Adrianna, the events manager, is wonderful—she’s incredibly responsive and so easy to work with. She and the entire team took such great care of us, and everything ran smoothly from start to finish.\n\nThe space itself is private (including a private bathroom), full of SF charm, and incredibly reasonably priced for what you get. Our guests had a great time, and we’re already thinking of excuses to host another event here in the future.\n\nPro tip: order the cucumber gimlet and the espresso martini—you won’t regret it.\n\nCan’t recommend The Owl Tree enough!"

They have an extensive drink menu, and the staff know it well, offer recommendations and guide you through it. The cocktails are excellent, with classics on the menu, as well as very unique combinations. You can tell there is quite a bit of craftsmanship in each drink. The cocktails are also priced well.",
          "If you're looking for a fun, immersive experience that transports you straight back to the 1920s Prohibition era, this speakeasy-style bar is a must-visit. From the moment you arrive, it feels like you are stepping into a secret world. There's no sign - just a mysterious door and a doorbell. Ring it, give the password, and you're in.\n\nReservations are required, and the exclusivity adds to the charm. Once inside, you're seated at a cozy table and handed an impressively large cocktail and spirits menu. My friend and I went on a Saturday night around 9:30pm and were surprised by how relaxed and uncrowded it was.\n\nThe seasonal drink menu is incredibly creative, ad the staff were fantastic - patient, knowledgeable, and happy to walk us through the options. The service was top-notch, and the ambiance was spot-on for the era. Dim lighting, vintage decor, and a vibe that makes you want to stay awhile.\n\nI tried a few cocktails, but the standout for me was the Heavy Artillery - bold, balanced, and unforgettable. There are a few house rules that help preserve the experience: 1. Be discreet with cell phone usage 2. No flash photography and 3. Remain seated and enjoy the era.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic time and would absolutely go back. It's not just a bar - it's an experience!",
          "One of the more well-known speakeasies in SF. you’ll need a password to get in (just make a reservation to get it). Cool concept, but honestly, I was expecting more.\n\nThe drinks were average, the decor didn’t stand out, and the service was just okay. It feels like the hype is mostly around the “secret” entrance, not the actual experience.\n\nIt’s a quiet spot, which makes it good for date nights, but there are definitely better bars in SF if you’re going for standout cocktails or atmosphere."

          "Between my cousin and I, we tried 8 cocktails 🫣and all were SOOOOO good. The bartender KB was also fantastic. We also got the fries which were divine! The only thing is that after 4 cocktails you’d think I’d be hammered and I was barely buzzed.",
          "Trick Dog is such a fun and creative spot! It’s a themed bar that switches things up every six months — last time I went, it was a poetry theme, and yesterday they had a space  theme. The menu is always super inventive, with cocktail names that match the theme perfectly. Drinks are delicious, the vibe is lively, and the music adds to the energy without being too loud. Definitely one of those places that keeps things fresh and makes you want to come back just to see what they’ll dream up next.",
          "Trick Dog was super fun. The menu was circus themed, with each drink printed on its own postcard. The drinks were extremely creative and interesting.\n\nOur server was funny, playful, and even pulled a tablecloth out from under some glasses at the table next to us when nobody was even watching - I just noticed out of the corner of my eye as it happened. Just a quirky dude being a quirky dude. Love to see it.\n\nThe food was great, though the menu is limited, everything we had was delicious. The \"Doggy\" sauce is the secret that makes everything tick. It's tangy, spicy, mustardy. A great sauce. The burger and dog in particular are great sandwiches. Also the kale salad is comically large.\n\nOverall just a fun, if a bit pricey, spot to have a few drinks and a few good bites."

The mood lighting, music that isn’t too loud and no TVs (but still a pool table) makes this an amazing first date spot or a hang with an old friend. Good way to leave an impression.",
          "Don't raise your eyebrows or give me the evil look, the evil eye hits its mark. It has a cool vibe, attracting a wide range of customers from young to old. It's loungey, it's low key but the cocktails are high class.  The bartenders know their craft and make you feel at home.  You can chill out or do some remote work.  Play some pool or chat up a new face.  I didn't try their food but their drink selection was worth the trip.  Next time I ll sample their food .",
          "If you are looking for a bar with a cool vibe, unique food and drinks. You should try this place. The staff was friendly and the drink and was was really good. Not typical bar food. More upscale. I went in a Friday around 5:30 it was empty but by time I left at 9 it was packed! Definitely worth a try"

I loved the heated tray on the table that kept our skewers warm; it’s such a thoughtful touch. The menu has plenty of options, and though the place is small, it feels very cozy and atmospheric. The upside-down umbrellas hanging from the ceiling are a unique touch. One thing to note: it’s quite dim inside, so it’s a bit hard to take photos. If you're taking a group shot, watch out for blurriness!",
          "The food is great and tasty. The bathroom is clean not smelly. The only problem is the parking, you'll have to find it and walk a little further.",
          "Had such a great time at Prime BBQ in San Mateo! We ordered the veggie fried rice, cucumber salad, mentaiko stir-fried udon with shrimp, vermicelli scallop with garlic, grilled oyster with garlic, and a bunch of skewers - shishito pepper, wagyu steak with uni, beef tongue, and chicken meatball. We also tried the Thai tea (with the cutest bear on top ) and a bottle of Kubota “Senjyu.”\n\nEverything was tasty, but my absolute favorite was the mentaiko udon, the beef tongue skewers, and the chicken meatball.\nAlso, don’t miss their $2 lunch specials (Fri–Sun) for oysters, abalone, and scallops.  Super cute space with Labubu decor and a big sake selection."

Cheddar&Jalapeño sausage and chicken (dark meat) was also 5/5 - easy!\nNo doubt I will be coming back and anyone who love Texas BBQ needs to pay them a visit!🤠",
          "This place is serious about barbecue. You can see just from the wood pile to smoke the meat. The food is fantastic! We got various meats and everything is smoky and tender. I am particularly amazed with pulled pork. The meat is chunky rather than stringy, yet it is super tender and, to my preference, not sweet. The mac and cheese is thick, so as sauces. The slaw is refreshing as well. Oh pickles and macerated onions are free to grab!  Capelo is now become a place when I think of barbecue in Peninsula if not the whole bay area!",
          "Delicious barbecue joint in Redwood City. The beef brisket was amazingly soft and moist, possibly the best brisket I’ve had on the Peninsula. Pulled pork was juicy, and the Mac and cheese and creamed corn were both very good. Fast and friendly service. Small parking lot with limited parking, though."

Feels truly authentic and it was absolutely delicious, the staff helped us with the menu in a very kind way.\n\nFor 3, we ordered a meal of Ribs with 2 sides that were Cole slaw and Mc and cheese, the ribs were stunning! The sides were ok, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nDishes and glasses were disposable which I am not a fan of.\n\nIt was an enjoyable lunch!",
          "The pork ribs were just amazing! Probably one of the best ones I’ve tried in my life. The beef brisket was a bit underwhelming - in my opinion it had way too much fat even though I love far generally. The Cole slaw was fine although a bit acidic. The interior was utterly basic, and the cutlery and the plates were disposable. Overall not cheap price-wise but still good quality and I recommend this place if you are around"

          "I'm not typically going for a BBQ joint but I think the warm weather or the moon position sort gave me the feeling of trying Baby Blues.  Honestly I'm happy I went and it for sure didn't give me the blues.  Yes the place is rustic some might call it funky but it works.  I like the big L shaped bar in the middle on which you can sit from both sides. That somehow gives you the opportunity to strike up conversations with random other guests or just enjoy the moment by yourself.\nI tried their Cesar salad Mac and Cheese and pulled pork shoulder sandwich.  I like that the pork wasn't smothered in sauce .  Sauces came on the side so to each its own.  You can bathe in them, simply dip or forgo them.\n\nThe presentation is rather smartly done.  The Caesar , oh well it's a Caesar not much to say about it.  The mac and cheese was rather tasty but could have stayed in the oven a bit longer to make it a bit less saucy.  The pulled pork was tasty. I didn't care for the brioche as it loses its texture too quickly.   I'd love to try it on a French baguette or a sourdough roll with a crust and id add gruyere.  Again the sandwich was good it just gave me ideas on how I'd try to enhance it.\n\nWell done thanks chef",
          "Hands down the best brisket I’ve had in years, It was so tender it practically fell apart. I had it with cornbread and mac & cheese, and even finished my friend’s Caesar. Not a single complaint. Our server went above and beyond and brought us some whiskey on the house since they didn’t have our drinks of choice. I’ll definitely be back to try more sides (and, obviously, more brisket).",
          "Solid lunch option for this region of SF ~ Good, not great BBQ in SF. Very clean and inviting bbq joint with TV's.  One of the few places around open at noon for lunch. The fries are thick cut and overflowing. The Brisket sandwich itself is solid but not impressive, good quality BBQ sauces. Staff is friendly; A great place with a good value. $21 for the Brisket Sando and fries. They also serve a diverse selection of Craft beer. Friendly staff, great beer selection all in cans and therefore overpriced. $9 pint cans of craft SF beers. The brisket combo plate was good, the sauces carried the meal.. for SF solid BBQ, relatively appropriately priced. Not s place that will impress you by any means. But a Solid option"

Enjoy with cold side dishes such as the standard Smashed Cucumber. Sliced Beef in Chili Sauce is fragrant from Sichuan peppercorn and chilis."

          "The real deal is Smoking Pig BBQ that features flavors and huge smokers!\n\nLet’s begin with the service which was quick, friendly conversation, and overall ok. It was a little interesting walking in you think you would order at the register then we were asked to sit first then someone came to serve us.\n\nThe atmosphere is rough, rugged, bbq style feel, and diner type of look as well. The restaurant wasn’t as clean as I would like it. You can see the bbq bottles are worn.\n\nNow onto the Main Event: the Food! The burnt ends were full flavor and good sauce 8.5/10. The pulled pork could have been warmer but the flavors and seasoning were on point 8/10. Fries were solid as they should be 8.5/10. The bbq chicken was good but could be improved on flavors 6.5/10. The cornbread and butter spread was really good 9/10. Overall this place is worth a try, places that smoke they have long cool times were can hinder flavors an heat depending on when you come so I always suggest multiple meats. Cheers!!!",
          "wow, a great no-nonsense Texas BBQ place. slow smoked ribs where the meat falls off the bone, potato salad, cornbread, brisket, four kinds of sauce, and a roll of paper towel on your table. we also got a plate of Wolf Turds as an appetizer: crazy name for three jalapeño peppers, stuffed with sausage and cheese, wrapped in bacon, and roasted. very delicious.\n\nwe got the large combo ribs with brisket and extra sides. more than enough for two, plus leftovers.\n\nLots of booths, super friendly service, mellow blues music, very laid back in a casual place, with lots of parking."

          "We ordered the beef brisket plate with spicy fries and beans. The beans were the surprise standout—rich and delicious. The fries had a nice kick, but the brisket itself was just okay—chewy and a bit tough, not something I’d rush back for.\nThe outdoor seating with wooden benches is dog-friendly, though it can get noisy with kids running around and dogs barking. I did appreciate the convenience of having a QR code with the table number to order anything extra once seated. On the bright side, the service was friendly and attentive.",

The brisket tacos are so flavorful, the salsa so fresh, and the corn tortillas delicious. This place is a little pricey, and the tacos are definitely small for the cost, but they make up for it in flavor and quality!"

I tried the brisket and it was very tender and juicy, highly recommend. The trays come with two sides of your choice—it’s a lot food so keep that in mind. The prices were pretty fair considering it’s quality and their location a few steps from the beach, their patio is awesome having a beer and try their amazing barbecue.",

The beans and cabbage was bland, though. Large patio area that is ideal for hanging with friends and dogs on a sunny afternoon. Plenty of beers to choose from. Fast and friendly service. Large free parking lot."

Thinking back I should have cooked but it was my Birthday!\n\nSadly the jalapeño bread, mashed potatoes, sourdough bread were the only foods I enjoyed oh and the champagne of course.\n\nThe service was okay but it was kind of crowded so it took the waiters a little time to come back to you but they were as attentive as they could be."

          "This location is huge with outdoor and indoor seating. The back room opens to a large dining room with plenty of group seating. Sparkling sake was good. There are a lot of peaceful decorations displayed around the restaurant. Good was okay. I thought the ramen noodles had good texture. The zen broth could have more yuzu. The pork katsu cutlet was pretty fatty. The chicken karage varied in size leaving the pieces cooked at varied levels. Overall a good place to come with a group.",
          "An very nice place to eat, the back has a more open feel while the front has more of a Japanese bar kind of feel. We spent about $100 on two appetizers, sake, a beer, a soda, and two entrees so meh on that. But the food was delicious and the atmosphere was great too. We went on Christmas, surprisingly, and it was packed. The service was practical, we enjoyed ourselves and stayed for about an hour. We got the spicy chicken, house ramen, some calamari and gyogi. The bento boxes are actually pretty big and my wife's ramen was great too. I'd come here again."

Could have used a little more flavor in the broth.  Gyoza was delicious.  Don’t really know if it’s made there, as advertised.  Overall, grab a Sapporo draft, get some gyoza, and enjoy this paint spot.  I’ll be back!"

I got the house “Hinodeya” ramen, and it checks all the boxes: decent price, good portion, and full of umami deliciousness. The wheat noodles are tender and, despite being mildly on the al dente side on arrival, softened up nicely over the course of my meal. Service was fast and the atmosphere is relaxing. I highly recommend stopping by for a bowl.",
          "Very nice place to eat at, Japanese music, they hit the drum everytime someone comes in, service was great and friendly.\n\nThe House ramen which was I got was good, the broth was flavorful, light but was rich in flavor. Every bite had me craving for me. The only disappointment was as the draft super dry asahi was a bit warm and the level 10 spice was more like a level 2-3. I probably would've enjoyed it more with a cup of the hot sauce.\n\nI definitely recommend this place."

          "I’ve eaten at the OG Jikasei Mensho in Tokyo, and somehow this spot in SF holds its own. The flavors genuinely compare.\n\nThe GKO Vegan is my forever order. It’s unapologetically garlicky, deeply savory, and completely umami-packed in that way that makes you pause mid-bite. It’s comforting but bold. I’ve tried to branch out, but I always come back to it.\n\nThe Vegan Tantanmen is also excellent, rich, nutty, and satisfying. The Miso is solid, but probably my least favorite of the three. Something has to be last.\n\nThere was a month when I had dinner here almost every week. No regrets.\n\nIf another ramen snob tells you there’s better ramen in SF, believe them. But also believe me. Then go eat as much ramen as you can, because honestly, why not? 🍜",
          "Mensho Tokyo SF is a cute little ramen spot in the Tenderloin. Went here by 5pm on a Tuesday, and was able to get easy seating for two people. Street parking was difficult to find, but thankfully there was a parking garage right next to the restaurant (Temple Garage). By the time we left by 6pm, there was a long line out the door on this rainy day. Food speaks for itself.\n\nOrdered:\nSpicy Enoki chips\nCorn wings\nA5 Wagyu sushi\nSignature Spicy Toripaitan Ramen\nSpicy Sichuan Pepper Style Vegan Miso Ramen\n(With a side of chashu pork and ajitama egg)\n\nAbsolutely loved our appetizers! Was surprised that the corn was sweet, considering we’re in the middle of winter. Wagyu sushi was fun and delicious - pretty sure it was real wasabi instead of horseradish-wasabi.\n\nOk so for ramen -\nTheir signature ramen was playful, with their rich and creamy broth. This was our first time trying duck chashu. Usually not a fan of duck, but this was good! LOVEDDDD the fried burdock root in this. Will plan to order extra next time, if possible.\n\nWe also tried their Spicy Vegan Miso ramen. **disclosure: I am not a vegan.** But wanted to see this style of ramen because the reviews kept raving about how much people loved their Vegan options. && it does not disappoint! I was surprised by the delicately creamy, sesame & porcini mushroom broth. The noodles are perfectly chewy.\n\nMy only negative thing is that the Sichuan Pepper Style makes the broth taste saltier than it actually is. When I come back, will plan to order the non-spicy version. Other than that - I can see why this little hole in the wall made the Michelin list.\n\nWill plan to come back and order:\nCorn wings\nSignature Spicy Toripaitan Ramen\nVegan Miso Ramen w side of ajtima egg & pork chashu",
          "Mensho Tokyo SF is truly one of the standout places in the city for anyone who loves ramen 🍜. It’s not just another noodle shop — it feels genuinely unique and deeply authentic, the kind of spot where you can tell the chefs care about craft, flavor, and experience 🎌. Because of its popularity, I ended up waiting in line for a little over an hour ⏳ before getting in. Honestly, the wait itself becomes part of the ritual; everyone in line knows they’re about to enjoy something special.\n\nOnce inside, the service moves quickly ⚡. After placing my order, the food arrived much faster than I expected, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. I ordered the spicy VGKO 🌶️, the spicy enoki mushroom 🍄, and a Japanese beer 🍺 to go with it. I usually have a pretty high tolerance for spicy and hot foods, but the heat level of the spicy VGKO caught me off guard. It’s intense — delicious, but definitely not for the faint of heart 🔥. If you’re thinking of ordering the super spicy level, just be prepared.\n\nOverall, Mensho Tokyo SF delivers a memorable ramen experience with bold flavors, efficient service, and a vibe that makes the wait worthwhile ⭐. I’d absolutely return — though next time, I might think twice before going for the highest spice level."

          "Food 8/10\nService 10/10\nWaiting time 1/10\n\n2h wait for a okay ramen is beyond absurd. Ramen is really good but would never go back to that wait line. I would recommend if you can get there before opening. Otherwise there are plenty of better options",
          "They’ve expanded the restaurant and took over the space next door. Basically there’s no waiting like it used to be. We were there around 1:30 pm on a Monday and was immediately seated (for two)! No waiting at all. Service was friendly and very very quick! Probably about 4-5 minutes after our order we got our food which was deceptively served in small bowls. But there was a lot of food and noodles. The broth was sublime as expected, the noodles perfectly al dente (small thin) with really tender pieces of pork. It was delicious and service was excellent but it was sooo noisy inside? It was hard to talk but for this incredible ramen, it’s worth it!!",
          "I’ve heard about this place for a while and finally had the unexpected opportunity on Christmas Eve. A friend and I decided to meet at Japantown for dinner. We walked around and I remembered this place. We decided to eat here. We didn’t even have to wait 5 mins and we were called to our table! Our waitress was SO nice! She was above & beyond! Gave us recommendations and answered our questions; and staff was so attentive!\nI ordered the vegan creamy broth ramen. It was good; however, I liked Hinodeya’s better as theirs was more creamy and I liked the taste better. Marufuku’s was still good though.\nMy friend had the Hankata Tonkatsu DX (The DX just means it has extra toppings). Apparently, this is one of the popular dishes. He said it was really good. We both finished our ramen so highly recommend.\nWe ordered the chicken Karaage as well. I have to say this was SO good!!! For those wondering, I know I ordered the vegan ramen but it’s because I don’t eat that much meat (obviously not 100% vegan or vegetarian).\nStreet parking can be tough but you if you’re lucky, you can find free residential parking or metered parking. Otherwise, there is an underground paid parking garage. If you take public transportation, the 38-Geary or 22-Fillmore (you’ll have to walk a few blocks, not bad as there’s plenty of shops & restaurants along the way).\nI highly recommend this place!"

          "Such a cozy little spot with tons of great food options! The ramen was super flavorful, the portions were huge, and everything just hit the spot. Can’t wait to come back and try so many other things on the menu that looked amazing.",
          "I finally made it to their happy hour, which has some great deals.\n\nTheir happy hour menu contains some of their ramen bowls off their main menu for $13. I got the garlic pork ramen, and they did not skimp on the pork. There were two thick pieces of soft pork belly that was coated with garlic and seared to perfection. And the meat melted in my mouth.\nThe bok choy was crunchy and its bitterness was tamed with the flavorful pork. The noodles had a good bite while the corn added some sweetness. And the marinated egg also added another flavor profile. Not sure what it was marinated in, but it had a nice tea flavor. And the yolk was perfectly jammy.\n\nAnd then there's the broth: full of umami, pork, and garlic flavors. I have been incredibly stressed from two projects at work and the moment I took a sip of the broth, I immediately felt at ease. The ramen was so comforting, especially now that we're experiencing autumn weather in San Francisco. I tend to eat fast, but there was no rushing this. The world and my worries melted away with each bite.\n\nI also got the amaebi shrimp hand roll, which came with a yuzu sauce. I actually found it to be a bit gingery, which was a nice surprise in flavor. It seemed the rice was also marinated in perhaps soy sauce for that umami note.  And the shrimp was plump. It was a good bite.\n\nThis is a popular spot with a small dining space, so a line can form pretty quickly outside as the night progresses.  But that ramen is worth the wait.",
          "It’s a small and cozy izakaya, perfect for dining alone or with a small group of 3–4 people. I ordered appetizers from the special menu. First up: Mentaiko Zucchini (so delicious! The very first bite was refreshing, followed by the rich umami saltiness of the mentaiko. A little dip in Karashi mustard made it even better—definitely a must-try! Highly recommended).\n\nNext was Kuramaebi, tiger prawns deep-fried tempura style and topped with tartar sauce. After that, I ordered Ba-ra Kushiyaki and Kobe Kushiyaki (served 2 skewers each). I especially enjoyed the Kobe—it was grilled perfectly and went really well with Shichimi Togarashi. If it had the same green onion topping as the Ba-ra, I think it would have been absolutely perfect.😋"
