          "Delay Coffee is such a cozy and refreshing spot! Their pistachio latte is absolutely delicious \u2014 creamy, perfectly sweet, and full of real pistachio flavor. The tea is smooth and comforting, and they offer an amazing variety of snacks and desserts that taste as good as they look. Everything feels fresh and handmade.\n\nIt\u2019s the perfect place to relax, grab a warm drink, and enjoy some treats. Highly recommended if you want something yummy and comforting!",
          "It's always bustling with people and for good reason. This cozy, vibrant caf\u00e9 has earned a loyal following thanks to its exceptional drinks and authentic Middle Eastern treats. It\u2019s my go-to spot, especially for their \ud83c\udf1fpistachio latte \u2b50\ufe0f, which is rich, creamy and perfectly balanced with just the right amount of nutty flavor without being overly sweet . Trust me, one sip and you'll understand the hype.\nThey also have a variety of traditional Turkish desserts and savory pies that are delicious. And if you're a tea lover, don\u2019t miss their Adeni chai - it's fragrant, spiced, and deeply satisfying. I recommend ordering it without sugar so you can sweeten it to your taste.",
          "Wonderful atmosphere, delicious, strong coffee, expertly created, lovely service... The staff is a riot \ud83d\ude02 they always make me laugh or have something to say.. especially the manager, I dont know her name but she always has such a great attitude and makes me feel better. I come in here all the time to order the Rose Latte, and work on some stuff on my laptop.. great to bring a friend"

            "text": "I recently visited Outta Sight Pizza in San Francisco, and it truly lives up to the hype. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the smell of fresh pizza and a visually striking interior. The experience was overwhelmingly positive, combining delicious food, quality ingredients, and a funky artistic decor that made the visit memorable. Yes, the price tag was a bit high (around $60 for our meal), but I left feeling it was absolutely worth it for the quality and overall experience. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my visit:\n- Pepperoni Pizza (Slice): Incredibly delicious, with a perfect thin crust that had a nice crunch on the outside and a chewy center. The pepperoni was savory and crispy around the edges, and you could taste the quality of the ingredients \u2013 from the tangy tomato sauce to the gooey, rich cheese. Each bite was bursting with flavor, and the slice was generous in size.\n- Meatball Sub: A hearty sandwich overflowing with tender, flavorful meatballs and melted cheese. The bread was toasted just right \u2013 crunchy on the outside but soft inside, soaking up the savory marinara sauce. It\u2019s the kind of comfort food that hits the spot; rich in flavor and clearly made with love and good ingredients.\nBoth items were freshly made to order and served hot. We could immediately tell the difference that quality ingredients make \u2013 nothing tasted processed or bland. For example, the tomato sauce on the pizza and sub had a homemade taste with herbs and natural sweetness, and the meats were lean and well-seasoned.",

The crust has that ideal mix of crisp edges and a soft, chewy center, and the toppings taste incredibly fresh\u2014thoughtfully paired rather than just piled on. You can tell there\u2019s real care behind every combination.\n\nIt\u2019s the kind of place where you can come for a casual dinner, a date night, or a quick bite and walk out feeling like you got something memorable.\n\nIf you\u2019re anywhere nearby, Pizetta 21 is absolutely worth the stop. A small spot with big heart and even bigger flavor.",
          "I can't hate this place. This is where my girlfriend and I had our first date two years ago. The pizza hits the spot and the ambiance in the small restaurant is so cozy. With just 6 tables, this small joint has a rotating menu with unique pizzas that will surprise you and keep you wanting more. Pro Tip: bring loved ones 9/10"

The dough in the middle was a bit too thin for me. At some places almost not existing. Some of the toppings seemed to come from cans. The half boiled egg was just added later and not part of the oven cooking. The trofie with ragu which my wife had, was nice too. Our kids had two kids pizzas with cheese and Micky mouse ears, and like it. Also the fries were thin and crunchy. The vibe inside is chic, a bit hasty and many questions \u2018how is the food?\u2019. We were here on a Friday evening when it was full, so a bit noisy which is understandable. The prices were high, but common in SF nowadays.",

I got there a few minutes early, so I was immediately struck by how cozy and intimate the store felt; the staff seemed relaxed but on top of their game, and I loved that you could somewhat (but not quite...to preserve the mystery of it all) see the kitchen work their magic with a partially visible container of prepared dough, slightly exposed assembly counter.

The tomato sauce was flavorful, with just the right mix of herbaceous, savory, acidic, and sweet, and the pizza was topped with a generous portion of melty mozzarella and basil. I love that they fully lean into the Roman-ness of their restaurant by serving the more ovular pinsa, with a slightly thicker, chewier crust and highlighting local Roman ingredients. Now that I've confirmed their margherita pizza (or, rather, pinsa) is 10/10, I can't wait to go back and try their other options!",

The patty was thick, juicy, and bursting with flavor and was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right so it stayed tender without being greasy. The melted American cheese added that creamy, salty richness that tied everything together, while the crisp lettuce gave a nice refreshing crunch. Each bite felt hearty and well-balanced. For the price point, it\u2019s honestly one of the best burgers we\u2019ve come across. Generous portions, great quality, and a taste that leaves you wanting another bite. We\u2019ll definitely be coming back for more.",

          "First time to be in the area so we had to try the famous beeps burgers. Super delicious! Burgers were made fresh and even just by looking at it you know that you and your burger will have a good time. Definitely worth the detour. Nothing negative. Just expect its a take out diner.",
          "This place is good,  but the quality can change any given day.  I swear I have never had the same burger twice.  This last one being the worst.  Still try it out,  but if you prefer another place.... maybe go there.  Burger wasn't as juicy as the past.  Fries were fine,  shake was good",
          "This spot is an old school diner with hormone free burger meat and free range fried chicken patties. They also have fish and chips, and breakfast options! You can choose three sizes of patties for the burger. Everything is pretty good; fries could be better. Order at the counter, or order ahead of time for pick up: there are two separate windows; order at the left window and pick up at the right window. Quick and easy. At corner of Lee and Ocean"

            "text": "So I went to this place with my mom while running errands. I had seen it before and I wanted to try it out so we stopped by one afternoon. The parking can be difficult depending on time of day, as its on the corner of Sixth and Santa Clara, but in the middle of the day there was a decent amount of (metered) parking nearby. The service was good, quick and the woman at the register helped us hone in on what we might enjoy as first timers. We both got smash burgers with their house \"six sauce\" and an order of tallow fries and onion rings to share. I also got a strawberry milkshake that was fantastic! made with Marianne's ice cream.\nI found both the fries and onion rings to be enjoyable however my mother did not and wished for more Jack in the box-like fries (her favorite, take that however you want it). I found the rings to be good. a good crisp batter, a nice grilled onion inside with plenty of flavor on both and the tallow fries were crispy and tasty as well. The problem we both had was with the smash burger and sauce. In addition to the sauce we got lettuce and tomato on them and we both felt that the sauce and lettuce/tomato took away from the flavor of the burger itself. The six sauce is very mustard-forward and as someone who can take or leave mustard it was sort of off-putting and my mother who loves mustard still thought it tasted too much of it. We both tried pieces of the burger without anything on it and agreed it tasted really good by itself and i would suggest that anyone going get the burger plain or at least ask for the sauce on the side and make up your mind that way. Overall a positive experience and worth a shot if you're in the area craving a burger.",

Finally it was my turn to order and I was met with one of their welcoming, well trained and understanding staffs that made the process a quick and easy one. I decided to order to go since my friend was waiting in the car where parking was not the best option in the area due to the overall safety. Everything was made to order which is the way I like it and I never mind the wait since I am a very patient person. Luckily I still captured a photo of my order even though I conquered my burger in a minute or two due to hunger.

Yeah!!!!\n\nI was actually interested in locating a Habit Burger Grill, but they're not in the city. Thankfully our local friends knew of this SF startup.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nI walked by it numerous times but never noticed it due to its nostalgic look and signage. The inside has a few tables with more outside along the sidewalk. No drive thru.\n\nMENU:\nBurgers, milkshakes, soft serve, wine, beer.\n\nFOOD:\nRoasted Portobello Mushroom Cheeseburger\nLike Five Guys, their stated \"cheeseburgers\" are double patties. Juicy, tender and full of flavor. Man, this was a damn good mushroom burger!\n\nFrench Fries\nNo combos here, but these natural-cut shoestrings were affordable, crispy and tasty.\n\nSERVICE:\nIt was Pride weekend so the place was pumping. Time from order to delivery was a quick 10 minutes or less.\n\nOVERALL:\nA little pricey but so worth it. This burger fan approves!",

          "Good quality burgers with reasonable wait times. Milk shakes were ok. Our garlic fries were an oily soggy mess. No table service, self-service sodas and free pickles. Seating is ok but not very comfortable, also the music is loud inside making it hard to have a conversation .",
          "I been here during late night when I was craving for a burger while I was very hungry. Upon arrival, there was a bit of a line, but I did not mind it since I needed some time to decide what to get since it was my first time here in general. Finally it was my turn to order and I was met with one of their welcoming, well trained and understanding staffs that made the process a quick and easy one. I decided to order to go since my friend was waiting in the car where parking was not the best option in the area due to the overall safety. Everything was made to order which is the way I like it and I never mind the wait since I am a very patient person. Luckily I still captured a photo of my order even though I conquered my burger in a minute or two due to hunger. I highly recommend this place to all burger enthusiasts, if you are looking to try something new or in need of a quick bite just like me. I definitely will be back to tryout the other delicious options they have to offer.",

I\u2019m not a vegan person but I must say, I\u2019m super impressed.\nWe ordered the Italian sausage pizza because I was curious to know how close a plant based sausage could be to the real thing. Surprisingly, it was very close and delicious, but definitely didn\u2019t taste artificial or processed! The pizza crust was crunchy, moderate thin (and with good texture) and doughy, and I love it. I they did a great job to let the customers know what ingredients were used (both through the menu and verbal), the service was excellent and the staff cared deeply if the customer had any food allergies.\nWhat truly impressed me was my main course, the Thai curry. It is the most flavourful Thai curry I have ever had these days, and it was served black rice. I love how healthy it is and yet it is even better than meat-flavored curry.\nWill definitely come back again to try more vegan food there.",

The masala bowl lacked flavor despite the name - the tofu, chickpeas, and pickled vegetables didn\u2019t come together well. The yellow curry bowl was spicy but not memorable, and again, heavy on rice with too little curry.\n\nThe cucumber drink tasted like straight juice, and was overpriced. The charcoal lemonade was better. The cashew cream birthday dessert was the standout - rich, nutty, and balanced.\n\nService was friendly, and the space is nice, but overall, not a meal we\u2019d return for.",

          "I love this restaurant! My friends treated me there for nice dinner after their engagement photoshoot. I\u2019m not a vegan person but I must say, I\u2019m super impressed.\nWe ordered the Italian sausage pizza because I was curious to know how close a plant based sausage could be to the real thing. Surprisingly, it was very close and delicious, but definitely didn\u2019t taste artificial or processed! The pizza crust was crunchy, moderate thin (and with good texture) and doughy, and I love it. I they did a great job to let the customers know what ingredients were used (both through the menu and verbal), the service was excellent and the staff cared deeply if the customer had any food allergies.\nWhat truly impressed me was my main course, the Thai curry. It is the most flavourful Thai curry I have ever had these days, and it was served black rice. I love how healthy it is and yet it is even better than meat-flavored curry.\nWill definitely come back again to try more vegan food there.",
          "Love this restaurant! This was our first visit during a recent trip to San Francisco. Absolutely wonderful experience at this plant-based gem! Daniel, our server, was top notch, and everything on the menu looked amazing. It was hard to decide what to choose and we are already looking forward to a return visit to try more. Highly recommend the curried cauliflower appetizer as well as the Fall Pie pizza. Heavenly. Ended the meal with the lemon cheesecake, which was very good, but next time I will need to try the chocolate cake. 10/10.",
          "Wildseed completely exceeded my expectations \u2014 the food was incredible! Every dish was packed with flavor and creativity, showcasing how amazing plant-based cooking can be. The ingredients were fresh, thoughtfully paired, and beautifully presented. The brunch menu is especially impressive \u2014 so many options that it was hard to choose just one!\n\nThe space itself is gorgeous: bright, tropical, and airy with an open layout that feels both relaxed and vibrant. It\u2019s the kind of place where you can linger over brunch and still feel refreshed when you leave. There\u2019s plenty of seating, but it gets very popular (for good reason!), so definitely make a reservation if you\u2019re planning to go during peak hours.\n\nIf you\u2019re vegan, vegetarian, or just love great food \u2014 Wildseed is a must-try in San Francisco. \ud83c\udf3f\u2728"

This boy was hungry and knocked off the whole serving meant to feed more than one!

We always get the seed loaf, really enjoy the rustic flavors. I enjoy the Pao de Queijo, and the onion jam that comes with it is my favorite. The Mexican street corn is mild and delightful.\n\nMy wife enjoys the daikon radish cakes and usually gets them as her main, supplemented with something else since they're a starter and a little small for a main. The choppy salad is excellent even in vegan form. The spring salad is also excellent as a vegan option. I've had both the fried chicken and the braised pork; both are excellent. The only quibble is that the \"damn fine buttermilk biscuit\" hasn't actually been that great on two occasions - it tends to be overcooked and not so tender. The cornbread is much better although it too tends to be overcooked. The Mac and cheese is fine but not spectacular.\n\nFor dessert, the chocolate peanut butter bar is excellent, but get the vanilla ice cream rather than the coffee cocoa nib vegan ice cream if you can. The dulce de leche pot de creme is excellent but very rich. And the key lime pie is also excellent, not too tart or too sweet - just right, but smaller than I would like.",

The biscuits were also overbaked to the point of being painfully dry. And while the starters were good, it's mostly variations on carbs, with limited vegetable or other options.

          "The owner Bob was very personable. We finished off a keg of barleywine and one of ours asked him if he had any chocolate stouts available. He said he'd go up and check, and five minutes later he showed up at the table to show off a keg he found, and ask us if we wanted him to to hook it up to the draft.\n\nOf course we said yes, and then the good times flowed. Fantastic venue, fantastic selection, fantastic vibe. Say hi to Bob!",
          "The main reason to go there is live music from local and upcoming bands, especially Jazz.  There is some exotic food choices such as Jerk (Caribbean) but not served well. We got food late on a Saturday night. Service was good and satisfactory.",
          "If you\u2019re vegan you\u2019ll be in heaven! Everything is vegan. The \u201cchicken \u201c drumstick is delicious hands down my favorite item. The jerk \u201cchicken \u201c and rice was pretty good the flavor of the rice was kind of bland. The jackfruit tacos were street sized tacos. It was hot inside so we eat outside which has a nice little setting.\nYes I\u2019d return the waitress was really nice and friendly ready to talk."

The burger was expertly prepared with a great balance of flavors and textures - the Impossible patty was juicy and satisfying, complemented perfectly by fresh avocado and crisp lettuce on a sesame seed bun.

The space is stunning with its modern industrial design, featuring exposed ceilings, warm wood floors, and an abundance of lush greenery throughout.

            "text": "In the bustling heart of San Francisco\u2019s Mission District, where the clamor of modernity often drowns the whispers of tradition, I chanced upon a sanctuary of serenity and sustenance: Cha-Ya, a vegan Japanese eatery that beckons the weary traveler with promises of wholesome fare and tranquil ambiance.\n\nUpon entering this modest establishment, one is greeted not by the ostentation of opulence, but by the humble elegance reminiscent of a Zen monk\u2019s abode. The air is imbued with the subtle aromas of miso and sesame, evoking memories of distant Kyoto temples and the disciplined artistry of sh\u014djin ry\u014dri.\n\nOn my recent visit, I partook in a repast that commenced with a sushi ensemble, where golden daikon and an array of verdant vegetables were ensconced within delicate rice and nori. Each morsel was a testament to the chef\u2019s devotion to purity and balance. Accompanying this was a sunomono salad\u2014crisp cucumber slices mingled with a hint of cinnamon, presenting a dance of flavors both refreshing and unexpected. A bowl of miso soup, rich yet unassuming, provided warmth to the soul, while a chilled Sapporo lent a crisp counterpoint to the meal\u2019s gentle nuances.\n\nThough my appetite was sated, the menu\u2019s offerings whispered temptations yet unexplored. The Cha-Ya Roll, a signature creation, boasts tempura-fried vegetables enveloped in sushi rice, drizzled with a soy-ginger glaze\u2014a harmonious blend of texture and taste. The Kinoko Udon, with its medley of mushrooms in a savory broth, promises comfort on fog-laden evenings. For those seeking variety, the Cha-Ya Nabe presents a hearty hot pot brimming with tofu, vegetables, and delicate noodles, inviting communal indulgence.\n\nIn an age where the essence of Japanese cuisine is often overshadowed by the ubiquity of meat and fish, Cha-Ya stands as a beacon for those yearning for authenticity without compromise. It is a place where the principles of compassion and culinary excellence converge, offering nourishment that transcends the mere physical.\n\nAs I departed, the lingering flavors and the establishment\u2019s quiet dignity left an indelible impression. Cha-Ya is not merely a restaurant; it is a haven\u2014a reminder that amidst the cacophony of city life, one can still find pockets of peace and purity.",

          "Enjoyed and would come back, especially during happy hour! You can get 3 small dishes for $20 during happy hour. We got the 1/2 cha-ya roll, Sansai udon bowl, and agedashi tofu. All of it was great. My friend and I admired all the paper lanterns hanging around us. It was a quiet, small, calm atmosphere.\nEdit: I have come back several times since my first visit, often bringing friends. Everything has been good!",
          "The food is exceptional!\nI went with my husband two days in a row, and we tried five items from the happy hour menu, ordered two dishes from the regular menu, and tasted two of the desserts. I also tried both Japanese beers (Asahi is light, while Sapporo has more character).\nEverything \u2014 absolutely everything \u2014 was delicious and worth it. Excellent experience, truly one of the best vegan restaurants in the Bay.\nThe service is friendly and attentive, and the place has a simple decor (it would be nice if it were a bit prettier; it\u2019s not ugly, just simple).\nThe happy hour menu is really worth it!\nThe location is great. One day I sat at a regular table, but I actually preferred sitting at the bar-style counter facing the street.",
          "Very good for vegan fare. The udon was tasty, and the rolls were inventive. I could do with less of the seaweed salad inside the bigger roll though it was hard to eat. Otherwise great spot and will be back!"

My group arrived around 3:51pm and we were around the 4th group inside. Service was surprisingly super quick. I ordered the Spicy Signature Toripaitan and it came out in less than 5 minutes. This started off being one of the best ramens I\u2019ve ever had. But unfortunately, about a quarter of the way through my bowl, I found a hair in it. It was most definitely not my hair. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene, so I didn\u2019t mention it to the staff, but I immediately lost my appetite. A family member ended up eating the rest of my bowl. I do have a photo for reference. I understand that mistakes can happen, but it was disappointing and affected what had been an otherwise great experience.",

As we were walking to get in line (3 parties in front of us), 2 employees rudely pushed past us on the sidewalk. It was clear they were late as the bakery was supposed to open at 8 am but did not open until 8:15 am. We got the char siu croissant, ube croissant, pistachio blackberry croissant, and ginger pull apart. The char sui croissant is more like a Danish but a good alternative for people who like savory pastries. The ube croissant was ok - although the interior was pretty, I thought the ube flavor was lacking. The pistachio blackberry croissant has a nice tartness from the blackberry filling. The ginger pull apart was very unique and delicious - I really like ginger flavored things so I enjoyed it (this is more like real ginger flavor and not gingerbread). I would get all the pastries again except the ube croissant. Overall, I enjoyed the pastries but I think B Patisserie and Arsicault are still my favorite bakeries.",

There is absolutely no way you can step into Schubert\u2019s Bakery and not feel tempted by at least one (and probably several) of their beautiful, perfectly made pastries. Everything behind the glass looks inviting, and the best part is that their desserts aren\u2019t overloaded with sugar. You can actually taste the delicate flavors, the butter, the chocolate, and the care that goes into each item.\n\nSchubert\u2019s has been a Richmond District institution for decades, and they continue to do what they do best: classic European-style cakes, tortes, and pastries made with consistency and restraint. I won\u2019t recommend a specific item because that would be unfair to everything else in the case. Pick anything to start with, enjoy it, and then come back another day to try something different. Just maybe don\u2019t visit too often\u2014because when you eventually step on the scale and see the results, you might find yourself coming back here to leave me a few choice words.

          "First time to try this bakery because of the reviews. We got the Asia Chicken Salad, chocolate croissant and vanilla sprinkle cookies. They were all ok, nothing to rave about. The dressing of the salad was good. If you want a quick breakfast, this place is ok. Prices are on the expensive though (spent about $33 for just 3 items).\n\nWe were not able to try their beverages because we brought our own. Maybe next time we can try their coffee.",
          "Walked to this cute bakery from Japan town. There are so many pastries and they are all amazing. I had the pistachio olive twist and latte which was not too sweet. The matcha and banana bread were also amazing. We got there at 10 right before the line got crazy but it would be worth the wait. The service is fast and there is seating outside as well as a cute park across the street."

The moment I walked in, the smell of freshly baked bread and butter-heavy pastries was irresistible.\n\nI tried their croissant and the famous Morning Bun, and both were absolutely worth the hype. The croissant was perfectly flaky on the outside and soft inside, while the Morning Bun had this beautiful balance of sweetness, cinnamon, and citrus that made it unforgettable. You can truly taste the craftsmanship in every bite.\n\nYes, there was a line\u2014but it moved quickly, and the energy inside was lively and warm. It felt like a place where food is taken seriously, but without any pretension.\n\nMy takeaway:\nTartine Bakery is not just a bakery, it\u2019s an experience.

            "text": "Another chilly but gorgeous morning in San Francisco and I am hungry. So I whip out my iPhone and use Google Maps to search for breakfast spots near the Mission District. Fortunately for me, Tartine Bakery pops up and I decide to head over.\n\nI actually find parking pretty quickly, and I know that I got lucky. I lock up my car and walk over and as soon as I cross walk in the door, I smell deliciousness. I check out the display case and I pick a yummy looking scone and order the breakfast sandwich. I take my number and sit by the window. The bakery is busy and happy patrons chat while enjoying their food. The vibe is busy, but relaxed, warm and friendly A few minutes later, my breakfast sandwich is hand delivered and it looks tasty.\n\nThe golden toasted crust of the bread mixed with the soft savory scrambled eggs is the perfect answer to my hunger. I try to eat slowly so as to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but the sandwich is gone too quickly.\n\nWhat can I say. It was scrumptious! I will definitely eat there again the next time that I\u2019m in the Mission District.",

While everything on display looked delicious, the morning bun is an absolute standout. I was honestly amazed at how good it was - incredibly fresh, soft, and flavorful in a way you wouldn't expect.\n\nA good tip is that while the seating is limited, it's generally sufficient for a cafe of its size and it wasn't overly crowded during my visit.\n\nFor anyone visiting San Francisco, I would highly recommend a stop here, especially for the morning buns. It\u2019s a genuinely delightful experience.",

          "Visiting Tartine Bakery was honestly one of those \u201cthis is why people rave about it\u201d moments for me. The moment I walked in, the smell of freshly baked bread and butter-heavy pastries was irresistible.\n\nI tried their croissant and the famous Morning Bun, and both were absolutely worth the hype. The croissant was perfectly flaky on the outside and soft inside, while the Morning Bun had this beautiful balance of sweetness, cinnamon, and citrus that made it unforgettable. You can truly taste the craftsmanship in every bite.\n\nYes, there was a line\u2014but it moved quickly, and the energy inside was lively and warm. It felt like a place where food is taken seriously, but without any pretension.\n\nMy takeaway:\nTartine Bakery is not just a bakery, it\u2019s an experience. If you\u2019re in San Francisco and love good bread and pastries, this place deserves a spot on your list. I\u2019d happily wait in that line again.",

          "Well worth the wait. Came on a busy weekend and there was a line \u2026 ended up waiting about 30 minutes for a table so not too bad. They make a good cup of coffee, and the service is pretty fast. I ordered the eggs with tots, and upgraded to the millionaires bacon, which was fabulous. Totally lived up to the hype. The omelette was also great, loved the multi color home potatoes. Will definitely come back. Yum!!!",
          "Delicious food and friendly service! The line may look long but moves pretty quickly, especially if you\u2019re willing to sit outside in cooler weather. The Bay Bottom Omelet is one of my favorites and comes with a generous serving of crab. Their bread is AMAZING. The fried french toast is good but tastes like dessert/fair food, so be prepared! The millionaire bacon is melt-in-your-mouth, sweet, and spicy. It\u2019s worth trying at least once. The food is always quality!",
          "When we saw the line around the block we knew it was worth the wait! Lovely little brunch place! Because of the size of our group we were sat quite fast! Service was ok, food was delicious and tasty, portions were small, and atmosphere was great! My favorite was the citrus batter french toast!"

            "text": "Went to Eight AM for brunch based on their exceptional reviews (4.6 at the time), and honestly\u2026 it felt pretty overrated. The overall vibe was chill and the staff was friendly, but the food didn\u2019t live up to the hype \u2014 very mediocre and definitely overpriced in my opinion.\n\nWe ordered the Egg Frittata, Nutella Crepes, Waffle, and the Avocado Toast Sampler. The frittata came with house fries and fruit, and while it was decent, it didn\u2019t feel like it was worth $22. The avocado toast sampler was especially disappointing \u2014 $30 for what was basically plain avocado spread on toast, topped with tomato, mozzarella, and a balsamic drizzle. It had almost no flavor, and definitely didn\u2019t justify the price tag.\n\nThe latte was just okay \u2014 nothing special \u2014 and same goes for the crepes and waffles. Not bad, but nothing memorable either.\n\nOne annoying surprise: they automatically added a 20% gratuity, which they claim is for parties over 4 \u2014 that\u2019s fine, but it really should be clearly mentioned somewhere on the menu or told upfront. I always tip anyway, but it\u2019s the lack of transparency that was frustrating.\n\nOverall, it\u2019s a cute spot with a relaxed atmosphere, but the food was underwhelming and overpriced. Giving 3 stars because it wasn\u2019t bad, just really average and not worth the hype or cost. Wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to return.",

I came to San Francisco for a 3 day feast, with reservations at various restaurants around the city, and this 1st restaurant ruined it for me. It's day 2 and I'm settling for anything on the menu that isn't hot at my second reservation this morning. Kinda upset about it. I'll have to visit again, but I will avoid Sisterita at all costs. Even if it were free, I don't appreciate negligence.",
          "Super cute Caf\u00e9 with friendly service.\n\nWe sat at the counter because the place was already packed, and that was our only option. Glad we did as we were served by the lovely April.\n\nThe coffee was amazing. So many other restaurants have incredibly strong and really bitter coffee and this was perfectly smooth and balanced. There are  lots of options for trying creative drinks and cocktails.\n\nFor breakfast I enjoyed the avocado toast with egg and tomatoes. My husband ordered the french onion soup which he gave thumbs up.\n\nWill definitely return."

            "text": "Honestly this place is perfect. I feel like it\u2019s just the right size and that they\u2019ve truly perfected the service speed, style,portions and recipes. I\u2019d almost not want to see them expand it because they do it so well currently.  You know how like when you double a recipe sometimes it doesn\u2019t come out quite right (or that could be just me \ud83e\udd23).\n\nAnyways I got the sampler platter which looking back at the menu looks more like it could\u2019ve been the daily special and not always on the menu. The greens were good solid greens like just classic that you could eat continuously. The red beans and rice were definitely a hit my mom and aunt both make them like that. The gumbo is the most authentic gumbo I\u2019ve had outside of my uncles. What do I mean by that? Normally if it has not been made by my uncle (from a line of Prudhommes out of Louisiana I think) the gumbos on the menus I\u2019ve had are usually just a pretty good soup. Theres always something just off about them but this gumbo was heart warming and I could only imagine what the deluxe version tastes like. If I had more time here I would\u2019ve tried it! My husband had the catfish de allemands and I think he said something along the lines of my God almighty when he tried it haha \ud83d\ude02. Safe to say he loved it. It was pretty good. Honestly we were both thrown off by the pecans in the rice but they were good but I\u2019d never have them anywhere else. Only at Brenda\u2019s now can you pecans in my rice I guess. Ok let\u2019s talk about the pillow soft hot beignet that I will dream about as we make our way back to the east coast. Wow it was probably the best no I\u2019m sure thee absolute best one I\u2019ve ever had. I think that\u2019s what princess Tiana\u2019s must have been based off of for sure because they truly were amazing.\n\nOverall the staff was friendly and efficient. They were not playing no games with us. If the came over and we weren\u2019t ready they weren\u2019t wasting no time. They quickly said \u201cwe\u2019ll give you a few more minutes\u201d and I appreciated that because they were just so many good things to bounce between hence why I got a sampler. But again we didn\u2019t feel rushed or pushed off or like anyone was rude. Everything was efficient well done and felt like a well oiled machine. I hope to make it back one day!",

Once we sat down, the food came out pretty fast and everything taste too good however it\u2019s hard to appreciate considering the wait. The shrimp and grits were very flavorful however, with the smoothness of the grits, as well as the sauces added, it felt a bit soupy. The crawfish beignets were a little light on the crawfish however, the crab beignet was amazing and full. I\u2019d recommend adding an egg or two or something else to the grits to give it some texture.",

The andouille sausage was fantastic and full of flavor, and the strawberry jam was truly heavenly.

Super excited to try this place so when I was in the area at 4:15 last Sunday, having missed lunch, thought I\u2019d stop by. Was surprised to see there were already people waiting for it to open and the line was quite long when it opened at 4:30. Reservations are recommended but we were lucky enough to be accommodated. A charming dining area, albeit not a ton of elbow room. Seating options include tables up to four, up to two, and a small sushi bar.\n\nThe waitstaff were very friendly and responsive and helpful with recommendations.\n\nFood wise, everything was good, including the miso soup and yuba salad, but the rolls are where the magic is. They\u2019re all beautifully crafted and presented. We tried the California roll (great!), sweet tofu nigiri, Missing piece (made GF), and Boddy and Soul (recommended, and a winner by my dining partner, but not GF).\n\nIt was a real delight to enjoy such delicious food, carefully created, crafted, and presented, making it a multi sensory treat.\n\nWish there was a GF tempura option to make more of the rolls available to celiacs, but I loved what I had. Definitely recommend the fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere and uniquely Japanese vibe. Think stylish onsen, an indulgence where you leave feeling fulfilled, healthy, and happy!",

Amazing plant-based, non processed, organic and locally sourced food, beautiful atmosphere, vibey ambiance, attentive and sweet staff. 11/10. Great for date night, a friend link up, or even a stop for dinner after work. Sitting at the bar vs the dining room is a different experience. Ask for the dessert menu! The red bean mochi donut is incredible.",

          "All vegan Japanese restaurant that has celiac-safe GF options - wow! Super excited to try this place so when I was in the area at 4:15 last Sunday, having missed lunch, thought I\u2019d stop by. Was surprised to see there were already people waiting for it to open and the line was quite long when it opened at 4:30. Reservations are recommended but we were lucky enough to be accommodated. A charming dining area, albeit not a ton of elbow room. Seating options include tables up to four, up to two, and a small sushi bar.\n\nThe waitstaff were very friendly and responsive and helpful with recommendations.\n\nFood wise, everything was good, including the miso soup and yuba salad, but the rolls are where the magic is. They\u2019re all beautifully crafted and presented. We tried the California roll (great!), sweet tofu nigiri, Missing piece (made GF), and Boddy and Soul (recommended, and a winner by my dining partner, but not GF).\n\nIt was a real delight to enjoy such delicious food, carefully created, crafted, and presented, making it a multi sensory treat.\n\nWish there was a GF tempura option to make more of the rolls available to celiacs, but I loved what I had. Definitely recommend the fun, relaxed, down to earth atmosphere and uniquely Japanese vibe. Think stylish onsen, an indulgence where you leave feeling fulfilled, healthy, and happy!",
          "Delicious vegan sushi that actually delivers on flavor! The Dynamite Roll (10/10) was the highlight, followed closely by the Roasted Bell Pepper Nigiri (9/10). The Shishito Peppers and Candlestick roll were also solid (8/10).\n\nThe price point feels high given the portion sizes, but the technique is impressive and it gives vegans a genuine sushi experience. Highly recommended for the execution, especially if you don't eat fish.",
          "This vegan sushi restaurant is outstanding, offering an amazing experience. Everything was absolutely mind-blowingly delicious. I would love to eat here every day. The service was wonderful, and everything arrived impressively quickly considering the restaurant was full shortly after opening. Reservations are required, and we'll worth the wait. The menu, atmosphere, and interior design are A+, 10/10"

If you are sensitive to sound though, you may not like it during prime time because when it fills up, it is very loud in there.

They have 2 separate dining areas, upper level being bright and perfect for families with the lower level having their bar with dim lighting and plenty of seating; if you are interested in their Happy Hour then you must dine downstairs as it is not applicable to the upstairs dining room. Depending on when you go, there can be long wait times but overall food still seemed to come out fairly quickly after ordering. Of my times of dining, I do prefer getting multiple small dishes and sharing to really take advantage and enjoy more of the menu. Personal favorites of mine will be any Lychee cocktail of theirs, the dessert platter to endulge in a variety of sweets and their 6oz Wagyu Beef with Bone Marrow.

We ordered multiple appetizers and entrees to share as well as all the desserts.  I wouldn't choose any dessert again as they were pretty mediocre\n\nThe ambiance is also top-tier. Sleek, modern, and upscale, but still warm and comfortable. It's the kind of place that feels special without being stuffy. Add to that an excellent spirits list with rare whiskies, great sake options, and inventive cocktails\u2014it\u2019s a dream for anyone who appreciates a good drink with their meal.\n\nOnly downside? The timing between courses was off. The brought our food to soon, making our business party of 6 feel overly rushed which  threw off the rhythm of the evening. And unfortunately, the restroom was in poor shape\u2014not what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nAll in all, Roku Akor is still 100% worth a visit for the food and vibe alone. Just hoping they tighten up service timing and take better care of the facilities next time. If they do, it\u2019s easily a 5-star spot!",

          "Absolutely an amazing experience.  Andrew was our server and he was great. His knowledge and helpfulness was great and made our night that much better . A5 Wagyu , uni and uni on bluefin as well as spotted prawns with uni and caviar.  Bone marrow and all. Absolutely an amazing experience. Would recommend it to anyone .\nI\u2019ve never bought a Japanese A5 steak before . I finally did it and it melted in my mouth . Worth it especially as Christmas gift to myself .",
          "Pros: the food was well prepared and promptly delivered. We sat in the downstairs area that was giving speakeasy vibes and I really enjoyed it. If you are sensitive to sound though, you may not like it during prime time because when it fills up, it is very loud in there. I didn\u2019t mind it, but I know some people like a more peaceful surrounding in which case the upstairs would\u2019ve probably been better.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, we had a good variety of food and I particularly like my dessert to come out with my supper and they delivered on that request properly.\n\nThe coffee machine was broken, which was a disappointment so I ended up having green tea with my dessert, but was still enjoyable.\n\nThe crispy Brussels were perfect, and the dessert was the perfect amount of rich and flavorful. I do believe the dessert was a bit overpriced, but it was a work dinner that a client paid for so I can\u2019t complain too much.\n\nCons: nothing significant. Our server was great and even got us a complementary hot plate to try. We only got delayed slightly with my tea, but it didn\u2019t ruin the experience.",
          "The omakase tasting menu is really great. Highlight for the mushroom risotto that comes in one of the courses. The place is quite expensive, but it's a nice experience for a nice occasion."

I am a sushi chef myself and was excited to watch the sushi being made and engage with the chefs.\n\nWe were seated at a table away from the bar. We made our reservation online through open table, and nowhere did it mention reserving the bar versus a table. There is only a section for \u201cspecial requests\u201d which I interpreted as a section to mention any food allergies, etc. As a result, we did not receive the full omakase experience we were expecting. This is something that should be clarified during the reservation process to avoid disappointing future customers. Maybe a specific question asking \u201cbar\u201d or \u201ctable\u201d seating reservation.\n\nWe would be happy to return for another experience, and next time I will be sure to call the restaurant directly to make sure they have my reservation down to be seated at the bar.",

          "great service and really enjoyed the experience!!\n\nthe chefs and hosts were all extremely friendly and made sure to keep our waters full and fill our plates right when we finished eating\n\nthat atmosphere was intimate and a great place for a small birthday celebration!\n\nthe omakase itself was quiet filling and the ice cream was delicious. I have had omakase at similar price point that i enjoyed more, but overall still had a great experience due to the presentation and majority of the plates!!",
          "Food and service were excellent - some of the best nigiri I\u2019ve had. However, we were very disappointed to not be able to sit at the bar as we drove 3 hrs for our first omakase experience. I am a sushi chef myself and was excited to watch the sushi being made and engage with the chefs.\n\nWe were seated at a table away from the bar. We made our reservation online through open table, and nowhere did it mention reserving the bar versus a table. There is only a section for \u201cspecial requests\u201d which I interpreted as a section to mention any food allergies, etc. As a result, we did not receive the full omakase experience we were expecting. This is something that should be clarified during the reservation process to avoid disappointing future customers. Maybe a specific question asking \u201cbar\u201d or \u201ctable\u201d seating reservation.\n\nWe would be happy to return for another experience, and next time I will be sure to call the restaurant directly to make sure they have my reservation down to be seated at the bar.",
          "Such a reasonably priced omakase! The corkage fee is only $35, which is a great deal. The taste, the portions\u2014everything was excellent. It\u2019s a hidden gem with no reason not to go. I\u2019m definitely going every time I come to San Francisco. This is the second sushi spot opened in SF by the owner of Sushi Jin, and the quality is so good, it\u2019s totally worth the money."

The others were good, but this one was special, had the right amount of food and paced it nicely for 2 hours. Really loved hows they got the sushi two at a time, rather than too many pieces. They also noticed my wife not eating some of the rice, and reduced the amount of rice in the future pieces.\n\nWould strongly recommend this place, go here now :)",

The Pad Kee Mao was just okay\u2014we\u2019ve had much better elsewhere. The green curry, however, was a real letdown: the consistency was thin and watery, more like a soup than a curry and the jasmine rice was also a little burnt. The Thai tea was also disappointing, lacking the rich flavor and balance we usually enjoy. Just the presentation of the Thai tea looked a bit cute.\n\nWe\u2019ve tried many other Thai spots in SF (Thai Spice, Farmhouse Thai, etc.) and they are far superior in both flavor and texture. Even photos of our past meals at Thai Spice show the difference in consistency.\n\nCleanliness was another concern. Plates and glasses had visible black marks and looked overused. We also ended up asking for to-go cups for our drinks instead of using their overused glasses.\n\nAmbience was only average. Overall, we wouldn\u2019t recommend New Thai Elephant when there are so many better options nearby.",

My friend also ordered Pad Kapao crispy pork and it tasted great (even though i prefer not to have the green beans in pad kapao). Price is great.\n\nThe servers seemed kind. My phone was running out of battery in their restaurant and the server lady charged it for me using their outlet!\n\nThe only con would be the location because this restaurant sits on where there are many homeless people. We were walking there and it was our first time walking in San Francisco so it was a little scary.",

          "Awesome food. And im picky about my Thai food  we ordered the green papaya salad, Silver noodle salad, the barbecued pork, and Tom Kah soup. Every single plate was excellent \ud83d\udc4d Service was great, lots of space and very open with large windows. The area is a little difficult for parking, Service is fast. Overall EXCELLENT food and VERY good prices....much less expensive than other restaurants. We were a large group of seven, but everything went smooth and fast.",
          "The new location is 1 block away from the old location which is great!\n\nThe interior is very homey, spacious and great for large groups, families and kids!! Large menu that accommodates all palates.\n\nI sampled the two poplar boat noodles (small sizes). They were so unique, punchful and super delicious!!!\n\nTo top it off, the service was inviting and welcoming!! Definitely an A++ eatery.",
          "Zenyai has moved to a new location on O\u2019Farrell Street, and it\u2019s just as good as ever. Same delicious menu, same authentic flavors \u2014 and still the only place where you can get boat noodles served in a chicken ceramic bowl, just like in Thailand.\n\nThe prices are very affordable, the new space is clean, bright, and comfortable, and they\u2019ve even added Thai snacks you can take home. So happy to see them in their new spot!"

The restaurant has gone downhill and I can no longer recommend it.\n\nMy partner and I came to celebrate a holiday and arrived around 4:30pm. The place was empty, and we chose to sit outside. Service started quickly, but the table was dirty and looked like it hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a long time.\n\nWe ordered two iced Thai teas ($6.50 each). The flavor was just average. I also asked the server for two cups of water, but she completely ignored me. Later, someone just brought me a cup of ice instead\u2014so frustrating, especially since it was really hot outside. The outdoor tables, tablecloths, and chairs all felt worn out and uncomfortable.\n\nFor food, we ordered two dishes. The first was their new Burmese Lobster Noodles. It came with half a lobster\u2014but no claw, and the lobster itself was dry, tough, and definitely not fresh. It was honestly inedible. The second dish was the Beef Cup Noodles. It was spicy and tasted okay, but for $39, it felt like a rip-off.\n\nIn total, for just two dishes and two drinks, the bill came out to $115 before tip. They even added an extra \u201cSF mandate tax.\u201d Three years ago, I had good experiences here, but after this visit, I won\u2019t be coming back.",

            "text": "Like most people I came here from highly rated social media influencers who claim that this is a great Thai restaurant. Beware, it isn\u2019t.\n\nFirst it isn\u2019t even real Thai food, it\u2019s a form of Thai fusion, which should be a warning sign. Thai food tastes best just being simple Thai food. For instance, Tom Yum Soup had coconut cream when a real Thai Tom Yum soup doesn\u2019t. It would taste better if they got rid of the coconut cream and actually cooked the soup with all the ingredients instead of just adding everything in the end. The seafood was also tuff and hard to chew. If not cooking seafood correctly, just don\u2019t use it.\n\nIn addition, stay away from the Branzino. It isn\u2019t fresh. It\u2019s frozen and it\u2019s redeep fried instead of being fresh fish in SF and it\u2019s not stir fried, it looks and tastes redeep fried from frozen. Deep frying the frozen fried fish makes it smell, tuff, chewy, and hard to eat.\n\nThe most outrageous dish was their deep fried papaya salad. Papaya salad isn\u2019t meant to be fried. It may get you likes on social media, but It doesn\u2019t taste good. It supposed to be fresh papaya mixed with the papaya sauce instead of being separated and for me to mix it, what am I paying the cooks for???\n\nBesides the low quality of food and taste, they like using sweet chili sauce for most their dishes. They restaurant is also over packed, stuffy, hot \ud83e\udd75, and waited almost 3 hours for unsatisfactory, over priced, and over hyped food.\n\nThere are far more better and actual \u201cauthentic\u201d Thai food and Thai deserts close by. This isn\u2019t one of them. Don\u2019t believe the hype, if you have taste buds and know what Thai food should be and taste like.\n\nSave yourself a two to three hour wait to be highly disappointed, like I was and the many others that leave the place still hungry.",

One of the servers, Jenny, kindly guided us on the different ways to enjoy the duck and her advice made it even more enjoyable.\n\nAfter finishing our appetiser, our main dishes arrived which included Mongolian beef and chicken fried rice.

It us a family style restaurant so they have found tables with turntables in the middle for the sharing of food. They have about 10 tables. The restaurant itself is cute and very connected to the Asian culture\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived, there were 2 free tables available. Yes, they are created for larger parties. However, many of them were. They placed us at a table to share with another 2 ppl party. We did not like this at all. As a guest at a restaurant, we deserved the right to have our own table. It was a totally inconvenience to the ppl that were already at the table. Btw.. one was a Trans. I keep wondering why they sat us at no other table with others that were also 2 ppl. Why this table?\n\nWe observed a YT couple walk in and placed at their own large table. We them observed 3 Asians walk in and they were placed at a vet large table.\n\nMy wife and I did not hold much of a conversation because it was weird!!\n\nThe service was accomodating until midway through even our waitress never came back up check on us or ask if we needed anything. Honestly.. we did not even receive water now that I think of it.\n\nThe food was hot when it came out. I was not a fan of the wonton soup. It lacked flavor. I enjoyed the House Noodles (shrimp, chicken and beef).. but it needed seasoning or more flavor. We ordered chicken wings. That was delicious. We also ordered fried string beans and pork. That was so good!!!\n\nMy wife had a Chinese beer and I had a cold Sake served in a bottle.\n\nWhen we were ready to pack up the leftover food, it had to sit because or efforts to be seen by a waitress to receive a box and bag was ignored. When we finally got the attention of another one, they immediately brought the check. Did not even ask if we needed a box.\n\nOh.. prices are really good and cheap. You get alot of food.\n\nI reccomend this place, with reservations depending on your race or appearing lifestyle.",

          "After closure of Oriental Pearl Restaurant, we are still searching for a near close joint\u2026 this place is on the first floor, just like Oriental Pearl, a bit difficult to carry a stroller upstairs\u2026 restaurant was 70% full when we arrived at around 6:30 pm, the soup was very standard, nothing exceptional though, had to add condiments to elevate taste\u2026Potsticker was stuffed with chicken, crab Rangoon was good, Chow Mein and Chicken Entree was great\u2026the house noodles was also very good, but limited prawns and chicken in it\u2026 the fried rice was again standard. It\u2019s an all women run joint, very attentive and prompt in service.",
          "My wife and I had dinner here last night while celebrating our Anniversary.\n\nParking is a little difficult to locate in this area, so we had to drive around for a bit.\n\nThe space is up a flight of stairs and there is no elevator. It us a family style restaurant so they have found tables with turntables in the middle for the sharing of food. They have about 10 tables. The restaurant itself is cute and very connected to the Asian culture\n\nWhen my wife and I arrived, there were 2 free tables available. Yes, they are created for larger parties. However, many of them were. They placed us at a table to share with another 2 ppl party. We did not like this at all. As a guest at a restaurant, we deserved the right to have our own table. It was a totally inconvenience to the ppl that were already at the table. Btw.. one was a Trans. I keep wondering why they sat us at no other table with others that were also 2 ppl. Why this table?\n\nWe observed a YT couple walk in and placed at their own large table. We them observed 3 Asians walk in and they were placed at a vet large table.\n\nMy wife and I did not hold much of a conversation because it was weird!!\n\nThe service was accomodating until midway through even our waitress never came back up check on us or ask if we needed anything. Honestly.. we did not even receive water now that I think of it.\n\nThe food was hot when it came out. I was not a fan of the wonton soup. It lacked flavor. I enjoyed the House Noodles (shrimp, chicken and beef).. but it needed seasoning or more flavor. We ordered chicken wings. That was delicious. We also ordered fried string beans and pork. That was so good!!!\n\nMy wife had a Chinese beer and I had a cold Sake served in a bottle.\n\nWhen we were ready to pack up the leftover food, it had to sit because or efforts to be seen by a waitress to receive a box and bag was ignored. When we finally got the attention of another one, they immediately brought the check. Did not even ask if we needed a box.\n\nOh.. prices are really good and cheap. You get alot of food.\n\nI reccomend this place, with reservations depending on your race or appearing lifestyle.",
          "I was so happy to go to San Francisco for my birthday. My husband treated me to dinner in Chinatown at Hong Kong Clay Pot. Everything we ate was thoroughly enjoyed. From the salt and pepper chicken wings to the Chicken Clay Pot with chicken, sausage, mushrooms and onions.This is a no-frills restaurant, but all the food is bursting with flavor."

For the price and the restaurant\u2019s reputation, the way the dish came out felt careless.\nWhat went wrong\n\u2022\tThe Peking duck arrived at the table with several pieces already missing, so it looked like a half-finished platter instead of a whole, impressive dish.\n\u2022\tThe duck was not deboned, which made it hard to eat and took away from the enjoyment, especially since Peking duck is usually served in neat, easy-to-wrap slices. Also, the duck arrived at our table as shown in the photo. There seems pieces were missing, I asked our server and was told that this is the way the duck is served. I have never been served a duck in such a way.\n\u2022\tGiven how well-known this place is for special dishes and banquet-style meals, the quality and presentation of the duck fell far below expectations.\nWhy it\u2019s two stars, not one\n\u2022\tThe restaurant is a long-standing Chinatown spot with a big menu and a busy, lively dining room, so it clearly can do better than what we were served.\n\u2022\tService and other dishes may be fine for some guests, but the mishandled Peking duck turned what should have been a highlight into a letdown, and that\u2019s hard to overlook.",

With so many other restaurants to try, I was never interested in coming back until a friend told us that he loves R&G lounge so much that he eats here almost once a month, and convinced us all to have dinner there, after we were turned away from 4 Kings. R&G has been around all this time, and lots of people seem to love it, and of course I can forgive poor service nearly 2 decades ago.\nHas R&G always been so big? They put us in large table tucked away from the commotion. They have multiple floors and even have options for private dining. I can see why large parties plan events here so they can eat the usual Chinese banquet dishes.\n\n$65 Salt & Pepper Dungeness Crab - whole crab battered, deep fried, sprinkled w/ salt & pepper seasoning:\ngreat! fresh & succulent fresh crab meat piled high with crispy garlic\n\n$50 Chilean Seabass (small) - marinated and baked in a glaze:\nokay! nice and tender, but due to personal preference I don't love glazed fish that much. Our other friends loved it though.\n\n$24 Roast Squab - whole squab roasted, crispy skin, w/ seasoning salt on the side\ngood! crispy skin indeed and quite juicy. Are we calling MSG = seasoning salt now? It does look quite like MSG, which I have nothing against. To me it's just another form of sodium. The tough thing about squab is it is not always easy to split up. Who gets the leg, the best part?\n\n$26 Steamed Clams & Eggs - steamed with beaten eggs:\ngood! steamed to a silky consistency\n\n$20 Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce - eggplant, black fungus, bamboo shoots & scallions sauteed in hot garlic sauce:\ngood! silky, spicy and flavorful\n\n$8 for 4 bowls of steamed rice, which we shared among 6 people, because we're too cheap to get one bowl of rice per person, but we never finish our rice anyway.\n\n3% SF Mandate is annoying, but nothing new\n\nI guess I am due to let go of the past and admit that R&G has some pretty good dishes. In fact, service this time around was pretty good. Who could remember that nearly 20 years ago, they took nearly an hour to return our credit card, so we can just conclude payment and leave, as if they were holding us hostage? Oops, I guess I do still remember. We're moving on!",

            "text": "December 2025 Chinese restaurant mainly serving Cantonese style cuisine in banquet style menu as well as notable cocktail \ud83c\udf78 items.\n\nA fairly formal restaurant with a wide range and standard menu based of the common ingredients and components.  They are generally known for their seafood dishes which are cooked well and consistently.  Some dishes follow trends while others are traditional.   Cocktail drinks were well crafted and on the strong side.\n\nSampling the lauriat or banquet style, the food order came through not quite following the menu.  Highlights are the crab, special beef, and scallops dishes while the duck was standard.  The shrimp \ud83c\udf64 version is not the crunchy type.  Serving sizes are a bit inconsistent with some dishes generous, generally ample, and some like the fish were a bit on the smallish side.\n\nOne issue they had was....as prescribed in the banquet menu, dessert was supposed to be included but when the meal was finally over the waiter said that it was not included \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nPricing in general was standard but also showed a number of inconsistencies: menu states Tsing Tao size is L but the standard bottle is the downsized one.  CORRECTION: Tsing Tao is now standard sized layer vs traditional Large bottle served before.  \ud83e\udee1\ud83e\udee1\ud83e\udee1\n\nThe final bill also has an automatic 20% service charge added.  No issue with the SC if only service was standard to industry. Service in general was not consistent and would need better attention to proper etiquette and rules.\n\nThe place is of three dining areas.  The ground is where the reception, bar, and a small area for small tables up to 3 or 4.  The lower floor is for larger groups and with 2 private rooms.  This section is pretty crowded and is typically loud and full much like a busy Chinese restaurant.\n\nAll in all, a good and relatively standard and a bit more well kept restaurant within  the busy Chinatown district of SFO.\n\nReservations are recommended.",

For the price and the restaurant\u2019s reputation, the way the dish came out felt careless.\nWhat went wrong\n\u2022\tThe Peking duck arrived at the table with several pieces already missing, so it looked like a half-finished platter instead of a whole, impressive dish.\n\u2022\tThe duck was not deboned, which made it hard to eat and took away from the enjoyment, especially since Peking duck is usually served in neat, easy-to-wrap slices. Also, the duck arrived at our table as shown in the photo. There seems pieces were missing, I asked our server and was told that this is the way the duck is served. I have never been served a duck in such a way.\n\u2022\tGiven how well-known this place is for special dishes and banquet-style meals, the quality and presentation of the duck fell far below expectations.\nWhy it\u2019s two stars, not one\n\u2022\tThe restaurant is a long-standing Chinatown spot with a big menu and a busy, lively dining room, so it clearly can do better than what we were served.\n\u2022\tService and other dishes may be fine for some guests, but the mishandled Peking duck turned what should have been a highlight into a letdown, and that\u2019s hard to overlook."

          "House of Nanking absolutely lived up to the hype. We ordered the mobu fish, five-spice fish, rice soup, tofu bao bun, cold sesame noodles, and apple prawn\u2014and every single dish was exceptional. The flavors were an explosion in the best possible way: bold, layered, and perfectly balanced.\n\nThe rice soup was hands down the standout\u2014number one. I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting it to be that incredible, but it was unbelievably delicious and comforting, with so much depth. Second place goes to the cold sesame noodles, rich, nutty, and perfectly balanced. Third was the mobu fish, followed by the five-spice fish, and then the apple prawn, which rounded everything out beautifully.\n\nThe blend of flavors across all the dishes was exquisite\u2014nothing felt one-note or overdone. The staff were very kind and efficient, and while everything is fast-paced and there\u2019s often a line, they move people through quickly and smoothly.\n\nTruly one of those meals where you leave thinking about it long after\u2014absolutely worth it.",
          "House of Nanking is a true San Francisco classic. The food was excellent\u2014full of bold, comforting flavors that clearly come from decades of experience in the kitchen. Every dish felt thoughtfully prepared and well balanced. Blosome tea and deep fried pork rib was excellent and the fried rice!\n\nThe service was great as well: attentive, friendly, and efficient without feeling rushed. Even though the restaurant itself isn\u2019t very large, it more than makes up for it with its rich history and character. You can really feel the legacy of this place the moment you walk in.\n\nOverall, House of Nanking delivers outstanding food, warm service, and a timeless atmosphere that makes it well worth the visit.",
          "Amazing American-style Chinese food! The honey crispy beef was insane. The cubed beef was so tender and rich- it paired perfectly with the acidity of the garlic bok choy. Absolutely delicious, though the portion of meat was a bit small in comparison to the veggies. The crispy pork belly bun was incredible, too. I\u2019d love to do the chef\u2019s recommendations one day but it felt like overkill for a single diner on a Wednesday morning.\n\nI went right when they opened at 11am but they were still setting things up. I came back around 11:30 and was seated immediately. There were only a few other customers so I wasn\u2019t rushed at all. Go during the week day if you can! It\u2019s worth it!"

The Juicy Chicken Momo with chutney on the side was incredible. We also ordered Garlic naan, which was soft and warm, Tandoori chicken, Chicken curry, everything was perfect. The service was perfect with friendly and attentive waiter who was knowledgeable about the menu.\nWe'll definitely be back to try more of their Indian and Nepalese dishes, and we highly recommend this place to others !",

Everything was 10x more flavorful than what I\u2019ve had at home in Massachusetts. The portion sizes are also great - usually I\u2019m used to having to order 2 or 3 tacos or a couple tamales to be satisfied. But just one taco or tamale here is a pretty big portion (for me at least!). The horchata was also incredible! The birria tamale is so cool - it\u2019s a must try for sure! I also had a birria taco and a taco al pastor with carne asada - also very good choices. The salsa that comes with the chips is also very flavorful, and actually a bit spicy. Nothing too hot for me, but I was surprised because in Massachusetts the free salsa is always zero spice hahaha. What a great place - I can\u2019t wait to come back here again on my next trip to SF.",

We tried both shrimp and chicken tacos as well as the traditional Oaxacan \u201ctlayudas\u201d (extra-large crispy corn tortillas topped with refried beans, meat, melted Oaxacan string cheese, and salsa, big enough to serve two, for about $20). I enjoyed them all!\n\nFor dessert, we tasted sweet fried plantains with the traditional sour cream as well as Mexican alfajores (cookies).\n\nThe space was comfortable for meeting my friend, a new professional connection, for a networking lunch. And the colorful decor definitely brought back memories of Oaxaca and made for a lively and upbeat vibe for our first meeting as well.\n\nOne member of the couple sharing lunch at the table next to us ordered the chicken with black chocolate mole sauce traditionally served at Oaxacan weddings (mole negro fandango), and that looked authentic, too, though I did not taste it this visit. During our time in Oaxaca, this was the signature dish that was served in fine-dining restaurants. I definitely will take my wife to try La Oaxaque\u00f1a\u2019s version of that dish for date night sometime.\n\nAnd I think this would be a suitable and fun place to meet someone new, not just in a professional networking setting, but also for a first or second date.\n\nThe person at the counter when we were there was friendly, helpful, and welcoming, and they cheerfully accommodated my hanging out on the Wi-Fi with my laptop after lunch until the beginning of the dinner service.\n\nI\u2019ll be back for more at La Oaxaque\u00f1a!",

          "Creative space that feels inviting.   We tried the guacamole, cauliflower tacos and the fried shrimp tacos.  The shrimp tacos were out favorite with a jicama tortilla.  The cauliflower tacos needed more flavor.  Still we loved the atmosphere and would definitely go back."

Some people say they make great mole, so I walked faster because I love mole. I have been constantly disappointed with some mole experiences around here, so I was keen on trying this one.\n\nI got the chicken with red mole to go. I used their restroom and when I finished, my order was just ready. As expected from an efficient, no-frill Mexican kitchen. That was a positive sign.\n\nGot home after about 3 hours. Took a bite from the now-cold mole and, wow, this is exactly what I was looking for. A complex, well-balanced mole (not that easy to find). It was kinda addictive and I finished half of my dish cold. The chicken was fine and not very tender and the tortilla was ok, but as a whole, it was a very satisfying dish, especially when you mix a little bit of black beans with the mole and chicken and eat it with the tortilla.

We almost over ordered (because everything on the menu sounded so good), so great thing that our server guided us. We sampled all of the tacos which already can get quite filling. It was a group of us so we got the dessert platter to cap it all off.",
          "This is a very nice restaurant with a beautiful design and a convenient location. The menu offers a good variety of dishes at reasonable prices, and overall the food was delicious. The orchata  wasn\u2019t the best, but it was still okay. Our server was attentive, and the service made the experience even better. Overall, we had a very positive dining experience.",

The corn cheese was so good and cheesy, it went well with everything. The kimchi fried rice was also delicious and all the ingredients came together perfectly. The BBQ combo is the best deal for the price and the meat was flavorful and tender, with an extra bowl of white rice to go with it.

As soon as we walked in, the staff was super friendly and made us feel welcome. The vibe inside is really cool and relaxed.

The flavors were amazing, and you can tell the food is made with care. It\u2019s hard to find a place where everything you try tastes this good.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for great Korean food and a fun atmosphere, Coco Bang is the place to go.

          "Super tasty late night dinner place! No reservation so we waited around 30 minutes to get a table. Service and atmosphere was okay, very busy vibes around the time we ate (8PM).\n\nFood was so delicious and filling for the price! The corn cheese was so good and cheesy, it went well with everything. The kimchi fried rice was also delicious and all the ingredients came together perfectly. The BBQ combo is the best deal for the price and the meat was flavorful and tender, with an extra bowl of white rice to go with it. I would recommend ordering any of these items because they were all so tasty! We still had leftovers too.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend coming here for a cheap, tasty, late night dinner. I do wish there was some dessert on the menu though!",
          "Delicious food, amazing atmosphere and great service. Highly recommend. The food was sweet and spicy and savory just made you happy to be there and experience what Korean food can offer to your tastebuds.",
          "This was our 2nd dinner of the night. We had the chicken wings with green onion and the seafood pancake with makgeoli and beer. Fun spot for late night food during a bar hop!"

The service was solid and professional \u2014 everything we needed was taken care of without being overly chatty or intrusive, which I personally appreciated. It made the whole experience feel comfortable and well-paced.\n\nThe food was mostly very enjoyable, with one absolute standout: the Poke Salad. It was genuinely outstanding \u2014 fresh, flavorful, and beautifully layered. The sweetness from the mango added a perfect contrast, and the poke was served inside a giant crispy shrimp cracker \u201cbowl,\u201d which was both creative and delicious. This dish alone is worth coming back for.\n\nWe also tried the stir-fried Shin ramen. The presentation was cute and playful, and flavor-wise it was exactly what you\u2019d expect \u2014 a solid, comforting fried noodle dish. The raspberry lemonade was rich and refreshing, and the dessert (I unfortunately forgot the name) was nicely balanced and not overly sweet.\n\nOne dish I would strongly recommend skipping is the Loco Moco. It was overcooked, and the patty was extremely tough and dry \u2014 easily the weakest dish of the night.\n\nOverall, Surisan is definitely worth a visit, especially if you\u2019re already in the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf area. It\u2019s a chill, pleasant place with a great location and some genuinely excellent dishes \u2014 just be selective about what you order.",

Our server forgot to order my food, so I had to wait until everyone else was finished eating before mine came out. They offered me a specialty fruit drink and 20% off my dish, which ended up being about $5 off. I appreciated the gesture, but considering the situation, I think comping the dish would\u2019ve been more appropriate, especially since I don\u2019t drink juice or soda, so the fruit drink went untouched.\n\nAs for the food, the French toast was definitely the highlight with a crispy outside and creamy center that was really well done. I ordered the Surisan Scramble, which was decent, though the bread that came with it was a bit burnt.

          "Surisan is located right by Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, with a great view and a cozy, stylish atmosphere that feels relaxed and inviting. The service was solid and professional \u2014 everything we needed was taken care of without being overly chatty or intrusive, which I personally appreciated. It made the whole experience feel comfortable and well-paced.\n\nThe food was mostly very enjoyable, with one absolute standout: the Poke Salad. It was genuinely outstanding \u2014 fresh, flavorful, and beautifully layered. The sweetness from the mango added a perfect contrast, and the poke was served inside a giant crispy shrimp cracker \u201cbowl,\u201d which was both creative and delicious. This dish alone is worth coming back for.\n\nWe also tried the stir-fried Shin ramen. The presentation was cute and playful, and flavor-wise it was exactly what you\u2019d expect \u2014 a solid, comforting fried noodle dish. The raspberry lemonade was rich and refreshing, and the dessert (I unfortunately forgot the name) was nicely balanced and not overly sweet.\n\nOne dish I would strongly recommend skipping is the Loco Moco. It was overcooked, and the patty was extremely tough and dry \u2014 easily the weakest dish of the night.\n\nOverall, Surisan is definitely worth a visit, especially if you\u2019re already in the Fisherman\u2019s Wharf area. It\u2019s a chill, pleasant place with a great location and some genuinely excellent dishes \u2014 just be selective about what you order.",
          "Came here right at 9 a.m. on a Monday for breakfast. The interior has a nice modern caf\u00e9 and homey feel. Unfortunately, the service wasn\u2019t the best. Our server forgot to order my food, so I had to wait until everyone else was finished eating before mine came out. They offered me a specialty fruit drink and 20% off my dish, which ended up being about $5 off. I appreciated the gesture, but considering the situation, I think comping the dish would\u2019ve been more appropriate, especially since I don\u2019t drink juice or soda, so the fruit drink went untouched.\n\nAs for the food, the French toast was definitely the highlight with a crispy outside and creamy center that was really well done. I ordered the Surisan Scramble, which was decent, though the bread that came with it was a bit burnt. Overall, the food was pretty good, but the service missed the mark and made the experience just okay.",
          "Visiting SF for four days .. went here TWICE! First time loved it so much so we had to go again!!!\nChicken cup bap was sooo good! Had the veggie scrambler w a side of beef patty.\nVery yummy and satisfying.\nCute patio."

            "text": "Having been here dozens of times over the years, Um Ma is an acceptable spot for patio Korean food with good vibes, especially on a warm day.\n\nWhether you are in Golden Gate Park or strolling through the sunset, it's conveniently located. Again, the vibes are good and the patio is a plus as it makes it dog friendly. Doesn't really feel like an authentic Korean place and it's a bit like they are trying too hard to be hip but maybe that's what sells. I recommend making reservations as it can get busy during prime time.\n\nThe service is ... usually sub par. Even on our best visit, it was still lacking. I want to be charitable and assume they are just severely understaffed. You'll often have a hard time getting a hold of them and even if you do, expect to remind them multiple times for requests. They've made it so you can now order on your phone but for any special requests, it's the same issue.\n\nThe food is pricey but a few of the dishes are actually worth it. Haven't visited in a while but apparently now they charge for extra banchan (side dishes)... what? I know times are tough but damn.\n\nWhile the patio atmosphere is nice and the location is convenient for many, there are better Korean spots even in SF (and much, much better in the Bay in general).\n\nOverall, the place is good but not great and while the atmosphere is lovely, things like the insufficient level of service and the inconsistent quality of the dishes makes it hard to make this a must visit for anyone.",

            "text": "Came here on a weeknight, never had trouble getting a table. The food is good but not great, partially due to the prices to portion ratio.\n\nWe ordered teokkboki, LA galbi, beef bulgogi, pork belly, kimchi fried rice, bibimbap. Everything was well cooked. Galbi wasn\u2019t too fatty and was delish, bulgogi was slightly too sweet but still tasty, kimchi fried rice lacked seasoning or taste, bibimbap had a unique western take on it, pork belly was mid.\n\nOne disappointing thing - banchan (small side dish) isn\u2019t free flow - it\u2019s just season quails eggs, spiced broccoli, yellow pickled radish and kimchi. It\u2019s disappointing considering these are inexpensive sides even from a restaurant owner perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve dined here on multiple occasions, I\u2019d personally recommend: LA galbi, scallion pancake, soonduboo jjigae, rock n roe rice and charred gai lon.\n\nService staff were good! We enjoyed our food and service, just oddly underwhelmed by needing to pay for side dishes which are free flow in majority of the Korean joints I\u2019ve been to. It\u2019s not a big deal, just in principle?\n\nWould come again if I\u2019m in the area. Total came to about $50+ per person with tips.",

The restaurant is small and cozy, and as many have mentioned, there was a bit of a wait since we arrived later in the evening, but we didn\u2019t mind at all. The incredible aromas coming from the kitchen made it worth it.\n\nOur table ordered a great variety of dishes including pizza col salame, lasagna classica, ravioli di zucca, pappardelle al rag\u00f9, and ravioli di aragosta. For dessert, my friend enjoyed the cannolo siciliano. Overall, the food was delicious, comforting, and clearly made with care.\n\nService was friendly overall. There was a small hiccup when I was initially served the wrong dish. When I mentioned it, there was some confusion as I was told it was what I had ordered. However, my group did hear my order, and as a vegetarian, the dish I received wasn\u2019t something I could eat. That said, this didn\u2019t negatively affect our experience. The rest of the staff were very accommodating, and the owner handled the situation\nwonderfully, which we truly appreciated.\n\nI don\u2019t enjoy confrontation and never want to make an issue, but I felt the way the situation was resolved spoke volumes about their professionalism and care for guests.

          "After our trip to Alcatraz and an afternoon of shopping at the Wharf, we worked up quite an appetite and decided to try Piccolo Forno. The restaurant is small and cozy, and as many have mentioned, there was a bit of a wait since we arrived later in the evening, but we didn\u2019t mind at all. The incredible aromas coming from the kitchen made it worth it.\n\nOur table ordered a great variety of dishes including pizza col salame, lasagna classica, ravioli di zucca, pappardelle al rag\u00f9, and ravioli di aragosta. For dessert, my friend enjoyed the cannolo siciliano. Overall, the food was delicious, comforting, and clearly made with care.\n\nService was friendly overall. There was a small hiccup when I was initially served the wrong dish. When I mentioned it, there was some confusion as I was told it was what I had ordered. However, my group did hear my order, and as a vegetarian, the dish I received wasn\u2019t something I could eat. That said, this didn\u2019t negatively affect our experience. The rest of the staff were very accommodating, and the owner handled the situation\nwonderfully, which we truly appreciated.\n\nI don\u2019t enjoy confrontation and never want to make an issue, but I felt the way the situation was resolved spoke volumes about their professionalism and care for guests. We left full, happy, and satisfied and would absolutely return.",
          "I was lucky to grab an outside table before the lunch rush fully hit. The restaurant quickly got busy but felt I still received good service. Food was delicious and staff was responsive. Would definitely stop by again when I\u2019m in SF.",
          "This restaurant instantly became one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco! The food is amazing and the atmosphere is just like you\u2019re somewhere in Italy. These guys serve you with the real Italian passion and the last but not least you MUST try their Tiramisu, it\u2019s from a different planet!"

The pesto pasta and the Bolognese are also remarkable for their authentic flavor and impeccable preparation. Portions are just right for one person and leave you fully satisfied.\n\nThe restaurant is often crowded a great sign of its popularity and they make the pasta in house, which you can watch while you wait for your order. Finding parking around North Beach (Little Italy) may take a bit of patience, but it\u2019s completely worth it.\n\nIn summary, a delicious and authentic culinary experience.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a charmingly rustic feel, complete with a well-stocked bar and string lights that give it a homey, comfortable vibe. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter was helpful with the menu.\n\nThe real standout of the meal, and something you can tell from the photos, is the sheer size of the portions. They don't mess around! I ordered a pasta dish topped with a generous amount of fresh basil and what looked like burrata or a similar creamy cheese. My friend's spaghetti with a huge, impressive-looking meatball was also massive, and the clams in white wine sauce were abundant and delicious. You definitely get your money's worth here, and you'll likely have leftovers.\n\nFor dessert, we had a simple but delicious bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. It was the perfect way to cap off a very filling meal. I highly recommend giving this place a try.",

          "I had a great experience at this cozy Italian restaurant. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a charmingly rustic feel, complete with a well-stocked bar and string lights that give it a homey, comfortable vibe. The service was friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and our waiter was helpful with the menu.\n\nThe real standout of the meal, and something you can tell from the photos, is the sheer size of the portions. They don't mess around! I ordered a pasta dish topped with a generous amount of fresh basil and what looked like burrata or a similar creamy cheese. My friend's spaghetti with a huge, impressive-looking meatball was also massive, and the clams in white wine sauce were abundant and delicious. You definitely get your money's worth here, and you'll likely have leftovers.\n\nFor dessert, we had a simple but delicious bowl of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. It was the perfect way to cap off a very filling meal. I highly recommend giving this place a try.",
          "This spot  offers delicious pasta and decent service. The classic Italian dishes, particularly the pasta, are a definite highlight.However, I would strongly advise you to skip the cocktails. I tried three different cocktails, and all were disappointingly similar in taste. Stick to the wines. Given its popularity, reservations are highly recommended to secure a table.",
          "Had a very yummy dinner here. The service was good, the food was excellent. I enjoyed all the dishes I ordered. The affogato at the end was a great way to end my night."

Paired with a glass of Viognier, Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay blend. The restaurant is located in a residential neighborhood, so if you're a tourist your bus/rideshare will pass by this place on the way to or from the de Young museum.

          "Such amazing Italian food!! Ordered a half dozen of east + west oysters. I personally prefer east cuz it\u2019s sweater. Absolutely favorite is the seafood risotto, so much seafood and fresh. Same with their signature seafood soup(?) forgot the actual name of the dish. But it\u2019s served with so much fresh seafood. Crab, shell, squid, mussel. Seasoning is absolutely spot on. Not too heavy or creamy. Such delicious food for amazing price! Def a 10/10!! Server was so nice. Just be aware they have added a 4% service fee. I didn\u2019t take it out because I feel they deserve that and to better survive in sf as such an amazing Italian restaurant.",
          "We came here to try the famous Cioppino, and it absolutely lived up to its reputation. The portion is very generous \u2014 officially for two people, but honestly perfect for sharing between three. The stew was incredibly flavorful: a rich, garlicky tomato broth packed with crab and seafood. Truly delicious and a must-try.\n\nWe had the oysters as an appetizer. They were okay \u2014 fresh enough, but nothing special. Since there are so many great places in the city to eat amazing oysters, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily recommend ordering them here.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. We were seated downstairs in the cellar area, which is thematically decorated and actually quite charming. The restaurant was very busy upstairs, but still well-managed.\n\nOverall, highly recommended \u2014 especially for the Cioppino, which is absolutely worth coming here for.",
          "A decent Italian cuisine. Good fish varieties (daily changes). They are famous with Cioppino (i find their tomato sauce less flavored) so didn\u2019t favor it.  The prawn and scallop saut\u00e9 is excellent; highly recommend it. Also oyster is great to start with. A couple of times, I tried their pasta dishes; especially the white sauce ones were better to me (again has less favor than usual but definitely not a heavy sauce)."

The sauces were CRAZY delicious and truly I'm not one to obsess over Italian food usually but it was so so yummy and memorable. The service was so kind. She let us try a few wines before deciding on the one we were going to get checked on us regularly, but not too much and it was just really really good service. Luisa her self was there as well sitting in a booth and it was really cool to see her just hanging out while I was enjoying her and her family's delicious recipes. the ambience of the restaurant was so cute and quaint and I can't wait to come back.",

The garlic bread was even better, made of course from that delicious bread.\nLuisa was at the restaurant greeting customers and watching over everything. She runs a tight ship, and the employees seem to adore her. I remember Luisa's the restaurant when it was on Castro St. during the 80s. I always loved eating there.

Watching the line work feels like dinner and a show.\n\nThe standout dish was the local, seasonal sand dabs \u2014 cooked to perfection. Bravo to the kitchen team. Another unexpected highlight? The tiny house rolls. I usually avoid carbs, but the chef (not to be confused with the head chef/owner) personally encouraged me to try them. I\u2019m glad I did \u2014 they\u2019re clearly a staple for a reason. Don\u2019t skip them.\n\nService-wise, the real stars were the folks running the line. One in particular stood out: a young African-American woman who briefly took charge during my visit. She had total command of the team and interacted with guests \u2014 including me \u2014 with warmth and professionalism. A rising star, no doubt.\n\nCoffee service also deserves a mention \u2014 an excellent Americano that wrapped the meal beautifully.\n\nWhy not five stars? A few things.\nThe front-of-house team felt a bit aggressive and not quite as polished as the kitchen staff. Not rude \u2014 just not operating at the same exceptional level.\nSame goes for the $22 cucumber salad \u2014 nicely plated and refreshing, but it didn\u2019t quite justify the price tag. Everything else on the menu felt worth it. This one left me scratching my head.\n\nOverall: beautiful ambiance, top-tier kitchen talent, and memorable dishes.

The staff were friendly and polite, and a special shout-out goes to our waiter, Jose, who was super friendly, kind, and genuinely attentive. His positive attitude made our experience more enjoyable and truly unforgettable.\nWe ordered several items and were very satisfied with the food quality. The feta fries were crispy and delicious, with great texture and flavor. The salmon wrap really stood out, juicy, well wrapped, and generously portioned, with no unnecessary spices overpowering the natural taste of the fish. The cilantro sauce served on the side added a fresh and flavorful touch that elevated the dish even more. The falafel wrap was also good, solid and satisfying.\nOverall, North Beach Gyro is a nice casual spot for a flavorful and filling meal, especially if you enjoy wraps done right. A bit more attention to restroom cleanliness would make the experience even better.",

We found North Beach Gyros, and I'm happy we did!\nThe service was amazing! The owner was so kind, talkative, and helped us decide what to order.\nThe food took a bit long, but I think it's because they make everything fresh.\nAn appetizer came out, I think it was Greek yogurt and then had veggie domas on top. The domas were good, I typically don't like them.\nThey had a couple vegan options on the menu as well as a number of vegetarian items. My family ordered a fish dish, lamb chop or flank, rice, gyro with chicken. It all looked really good. My family loved it, nothing got taken home, it was all finished.\nMy dish was an eggplant dish, it was delicious! The kids even loved it. One order of fries is large enough to share FYI.\nI definitely want to go back.\nThe owner brought us decaffeinated warm tea and a baklava to share, it was DELICIOUS! It was a Saturday and they had live music, it was a nice atmosphere. The decor is nice, modern, very clean. Tables are set nicely. Very well priced, especially for what you get. We got lucky and got free street parking since it was after 6 p.m. we read there is a parking garage in walkable distance.",

Save room for the baklava which is served warm with pistachio ice cream and strawberries soaked in honey with walnuts.  The service all round was very efficient.  Ali, our server, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and wine. We definitely plan to go back.\nOne bit of feedback I would give the manager is to lower the music when there are lots of people.  It was ok for us as we ate early before it got crowded.  But with lots of people it would be too loud.  (It's a pet peeve of mine.  Music in restaurants is almost always too loud and hinders conversation.)",

          "Our first time at Milos Meze and we absolutely loved it! The staff was very kind, friendly, and attentive.\n\nWe tried the spicy hitipiti, saghanaki, horiatiki salad, beef souvlaki, and lavraki. The saghanaki stole the show - reminded me of an Argentine provoleta. Delicious melted cheese with lemon. We also loved the beef souvlaki - it was very tender, smoky, and perfectly cooked. For dessert we tried the baklavaki which was super yummy and very generous portion.\n\nVery cozy, family feeling great for all ages and occasions. Cant wait to come back!",
          "Absolutely love Milos Meze!\nThis place is one of my favorites in San Francisco. The food is always fresh and absolutely delicious every dish is full of flavor and beautifully prepared. The staff is amazing so friendly, attentive, and helpful every single time I visit. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, perfect for a relaxing dinner or a night out with friends. Everything here feels genuine and full of heart. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves great Mediterranean food and great service!",
          "Found Milos Meze on Yelp and decided to give it a shot after seeing all the great reviews. Totally worth it. The place has amazing food, great vibes, and top-notch service. We tried a bunch of different dishes and every single one was fresh and packed with flavor. Big shout-out to our server Ali \u2014 super friendly and really made the night special. Easily a 5-star spot and one I\u2019ll be recommending to friends for sure."

The pomegranate chicken while sweet had a ton of flavor and I'd get it again next time I'm back.",
          "Just finished my dessert and OMG was it amazing! The tea comes in a large glass cup- exactly how my Eastern European heart likes it. I had the Trio dessert which is 3 smaller size desserts- bakhlava, chocolate mousse and a mindblowing creme thing with pistachios, I forgot how to say or spell it after I tasted it. Sooo delicious and refreshing! The place is small but cozy, every table and piece of decor is almost a piece of art. Very authentic Mediterannean vibe, and the staff is great. I highly recommend and will be back \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d\ud83e\udd70"

While they were \u201clunch\u201d specials, the portions were very generous! Truffle fries were our appetizers - BEST TRUFFLE FRIES EVER! Our group had a mix of starters, Caesar salad, beet salad, and  clam chowder, all were superb. The Red Snapper, ordered by all, was the best fish any of us have had! A lemon tart finished off the meal. It was a perfect ending. FIND THIS PLACE ON THE DOCK!! You\u2019ll be sorry if you don\u2019t.",

Also the clam chowder with fresh Manila clams in there with side of French fries. They're all delicious and their service was great.

All washed down with a couple of glasses of Riesling which complemented everything. It appeared hugely popular which is always a good sign but as you can't reserve a table allow plenty of time as there is only a queue system. I only had to wait about 10 minutes on a Saturday at 19:30. Well worth a visit.",

So they had only 5 seats available from 8 to 1130am. I waited about 3 hours and got finally seated.\n\nThe food and service made up for the long wait.\n\nThe highlight was the crab-santhemum -- leg meat arranged like flower petals of a chrysanthemum. Very flavorful. I liked it with a bit of crab back + Louie sauce.\n\nAnother highlight was the smoked salmon. The bread is sliced thin, so you can fully enjoy the buttery smoked salmon.\n\nCombination cocktail was great value as I got to have oyster, prawn, crab (2 leg + lots of white meat), AND shrimp. I liked mixing the white crab meat with crab back. With shrimp, I enjoyed making little sandwiches with bread, butter, Louie sauce.\n\nBoston style clam chowder had good flavours. The chili sauce went perfectly with it. It's not as thick as new england chowder.\n\nThe Sicilian sashimi plate came with scallop, yellowtail, ahi tuna, and salmon. The scallop was outstanding, but the other fish were just fine. I don't think I would get it again. The flavours were not as impressive as how the dish looks.\n\nNext time I want to try another off-menu item, scallops with ponzu and Sriracha sauce. Or the cherry stone clams.",

Super fresh, briny, and perfectly chilled. You could really taste the quality, and they were definitely the highlight of our visit. I\u2019d honestly come back just for those.\n\nUnfortunately, everything else we ordered was kind of a letdown. We tried a soup (can\u2019t remember the name), but it was bitter and just didn\u2019t taste right \u2014 not something I\u2019d recommend at all. The fish and chips sounded promising but were greasy and bland, like the fish had no seasoning and the batter was too heavy. The milky bread was another miss \u2014 dry, dense, and didn\u2019t really pair well with anything.\n\nThe service was also pretty inconsistent. When we first arrived, we were seated at the wrong table, and our first server seemed annoyed about it \u2014 definitely gave off \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here\u201d vibes. It felt like he usually worked the non\u2013happy hour section and wasn\u2019t thrilled to have to reset a table for our larger group. Once we got moved to the correct happy hour section though, the vibe completely changed. The staff there were so much friendlier and more attentive, which helped make up for the rocky start.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d say Waterbar is worth it if you\u2019re here for oysters during happy hour, but that\u2019s about it. The oysters are fantastic, but the rest of the food and service didn\u2019t live up to the same standard.",

The risotto was fantastic the short ribs were a 4/5 as you ate in they actually were a little dry and the leeks should have been cut down instead of the whole leak being placed in there. However as an absolute hater of mushrooms those weren\u2019t terrible. I did hear that their menu is changed and printed daily which I thought was nice.\n\nWe made reservations earlier in the day and had to wait about a 10-15 mins past the reservation time so I definitely recommend making a reservation. However we waited near the bar and were asked multiple times if we needed anything wanted a cocktail while we waited and more so that was a nice touch.\n\nThe ambiance was really nice and we sat right next to one of the fish tanks which I  loved. It\u2019s definitely perfect for a date night with intimate table seating. I am not sure about the outside because we quickly passed by it on our way in.\nOverall it was nice to eat there and the vibe of the place was wonderful but it\u2019s not some place I\u2019d feel the need to frequent.

The roll itself also felt really small compared to other places in the city and especially for its price. The waffle fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

          "I ride my bike down Valencia weekly and have always wanted to give this place a try. For lunch, it was a one man show so it took like 25 minutes for my order to be ready. I got the cheese steak combo with fries and a drink. The cheese steak was severely underwhelming and bland. The roll itself also felt really small compared to other places in the city and especially for its price. The waffle fries were perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was just lacking salt and pepper but an easy fix. Overall, I don't think I would come back unless I was in the area wanting a sandwich. Maybe I'll try something else on the menu next time.",
          "Consistently high quality every time. Staff is friendly and location is good. Their chicken sandwich keeps me coming back.",
          "Jake's Steaks is renowned for its delicious, hearty steaks and classic American comfort food. The steaks are cooked to perfection, and the menu features a variety of flavorful sides and dishes that complement the main course. The friendly atmosphere makes it a great spot for a satisfying meal. Overall, a reliable choice for steak lovers."

The sandwich makers/meat slicers/deli professionals were super busy but still had time to help point out the wine I was looking for. I got the Luciano Special, I could only eat half, but the fresh focaccia and the salty prosciutto with the delicious mozzarella and hint of acid from the sun dried tomatoes and the lettuce helping to cut through the saltiness of the meat, I got one of the best sandwiches in my life. My husband ordered the sausage and pepper sandwich and devoured it, according to the noises he was making I had to assume he really enjoyed it. Im sure he mumbled something with a mouth full of sandwich declaring that the hour wait was worth it. Definitely a must stop if you are in Little Italy. It is San Fran, not the most budget friendly city but two sandwiches for $40 seems very reasonable especially for the quality that you get. If you love cheese they have a nice selection of those as well as other goodies available.",

Right from the start, the staff asked us to move away from a certain area in a rather impolite manner, even though others around us weren't asked to do the same. On top of that, the line was incredibly long, and the prices were outrageously high ($24 for a sandwich?). The sandwich itself was just average, with nothing special, just a basic combination of cold turkey and standard ingredients, some sauces on top and that's that. Overall, it didn't quite meet our expectations, especially compared to other sandwich places like Bite, or Saigon Sandwich for a super cheap and delicious banh mi. Wouldn't recommend this for anyone especially people who liked hyped places.",

The bread here is PHENOMENAL, baked fresh right behind the counter! The banh mi ranges from $5.50-$7. I ordered the Special Combination (thit cha pate, which has roast pork, Vietnamese ham, and pate) for $7 but added extra pate for an additional $1.\n\nWHEN I SAY EXTRA PATE, THEY PUT EXTRA PATE!! There was the THICKEST LAYER of pate I've ever seen in my life here, probably a little more than half an inch thick, THIS IS WORTH $1 EXTRA!! The pate was savory, nicely seasoned, and just overall tasty. The roast pork was very tender and slightly sweet, definitely not your usual banh mi filling in America, but made the entire sandwich really savory. The cha lua (Vietnamese ham) was cut a bit too thin for me personally but the amount of pate they put really made up for everything.\n\nThe star of the show is absolutely the bread. Crispy on the outside but extremely soft and warm on the inside, the bread itself has a nice flavor just on its own. Its thicker than what I'm used to so there's more pillowy goodness inside. They make the perfect bread here!\n\nCraving another banh mi with extra pate from here as I write this. Absolutely coming back",

It is such a good deal for a sandwich this good to be less than 8 dollars. I'd eat these far too often if I lived nearby. I see why the Infatuation holds this place in high praise.",
          "CASH ONLY. Stumbled upon this unassuming banh mi spot after staying at the Motel 6 around the corner for Santacon. WOW!!! The bread here is PHENOMENAL, baked fresh right behind the counter! The banh mi ranges from $5.50-$7. I ordered the Special Combination (thit cha pate, which has roast pork, Vietnamese ham, and pate) for $7 but added extra pate for an additional $1.\n\nWHEN I SAY EXTRA PATE, THEY PUT EXTRA PATE!! There was the THICKEST LAYER of pate I've ever seen in my life here, probably a little more than half an inch thick, THIS IS WORTH $1 EXTRA!! The pate was savory, nicely seasoned, and just overall tasty. The roast pork was very tender and slightly sweet, definitely not your usual banh mi filling in America, but made the entire sandwich really savory. The cha lua (Vietnamese ham) was cut a bit too thin for me personally but the amount of pate they put really made up for everything.\n\nThe star of the show is absolutely the bread. Crispy on the outside but extremely soft and warm on the inside, the bread itself has a nice flavor just on its own. Its thicker than what I'm used to so there's more pillowy goodness inside. They make the perfect bread here!\n\nCraving another banh mi with extra pate from here as I write this. Absolutely coming back"

I\u2019m honestly not usually the world\u2019s biggest ice cream fan (a foodie crime, I know), but I occasionally find a spot with expertly crafted, unique flavors that changes my mind. Garden Creamery is one of those gems \u2014 they have a slew of outstanding Asian-inspired flavors, perfectly crafted to be super rich, smooth, and (critically) not overly sweet. Several flavors also have fun crunchy mix-ins, which offer a great flavor and texture contrast.\n\nThe store is super cute, with its cozy string lights and rows upon rows of doggo Polaroids, but it is quite small. The line frequently goes out the door and around the block, although it does move decently fast. Each guest is allowed to sample a max of four flavors, which helps keep the line moving but does make for hard decisions \u2014 every flavor looks drool-worthy!\n\nI sampled the genmaicha, salty kaya, hojicha, and black sesame, all of which were outstanding. The tea-based scoops had a great earthiness from the tea, with slight floral notes. The hojicha was wonderfully roasty and the genmaicha had toasted rice mixed in that helped amp up the flavor. The black sesame and a similarly nutty and roasted flavor, and it wasn\u2019t overly sweet. The salty kaya was a wonderful sweet and savory combo, perfect for pairing with a sweeter or fruitier scoop, but also delicious in its own. It was hard to choose just two for my standard cup, but I eventually settled on the genmaicha and then went out on a limb for the fifth flavor that I wanted to try but couldn\u2019t fit in, their strawberry lychee yuzu sorbet. Similar to the ice cream, the sorbet was super smooth and didn\u2019t have a single hint of ice crystals; it was fruity, sweet but not overwhelming, and quite refreshing. It went wonderfully with the genmaicha (matcha and strawberry is a classic pairing, after all), and I loved the combo. I can\u2019t wait to come back to try all their other flavors!",

But we also love it because they always have vegan options. We don\u2019t do well with dairy, so we\u2019re always willing to take dairy pills to have these delicious flavors. But we also love that they are vegan flavors are also high-quality! It\u2019s nothing fancy, it\u2019s just ice cream. But they do it very well.",
          "Got two flavors split scoop: Cinnamon Snickerdoodle and Sea Salt w/ Caramel Ribbons. I think the value is decent and it was definitely a lot of ice cream for a me.\n\nGot to sample a ton of flavors that were very interesting, including: Strawberry Honey Balsamic, Goat Cheese Marionberry Habanero, and pickled cucumber Sorbet.\n\nIt was kinda dirty in this area (streets/sidewalk) and also dirty inside (tables and floors). But it seemed clean behind the counter, so I wasn\u2019t worried about the ice cream being contaminated.",

            "text": "I need to preface this review with a confession: I gained weight living down the block from Salt & Straw. I liked it too much. After discovering this place, I became convinced that heaven on earth does in fact exist\u2014and it comes in a waffle cone.\n\nI first heard about Salt & Straw at Alta Plaza Park, where a couple in love, lounging on a red-and-white gingham blanket, kindly pet my overly curious dog. \u201cThis is Salt & Straw,\u201d they said. \u201cBest ice cream in the city.\u201d The next day I walked over, only to find a line stretching down the block. It took me months to build up the patience to wait it out.\n\nWhen I finally reached the counter, I realized Salt & Straw isn\u2019t your typical scoop shop. They\u2019re known for wildly inventive flavors that sound improbable, even impossible\u2014savory ingredients turned into ice cream. Seasonal menus have included pumpkin pie, Thanksgiving stuffing, and cranberry sauce. My first order was pear and blue cheese, and it was a revelation: a flavor explosion that made me rethink what ice cream could be.\n\nBut the true magic came when my son and I discovered what has since become our all-time favorite flavor\u2014not just at Salt & Straw, but anywhere: **Strawberry Honey Balsamic Vinegar with Black Pepper.** It\u2019s woven with homemade strawberry jam that is, quite simply, the most delicious jam in the world. After his first bite, my then 11-year-old son looked at me and said, \u201cMom, ice cream doesn\u2019t get any better.\u201d He was right. From that moment on, we stopped experimenting with other flavors. That one became our go-to, and thankfully, it\u2019s available by the quart\u2014meaning we can skip the line and still bring home perfection.\n\nSalt & Straw is more than an ice cream shop. It\u2019s a place where flavor becomes adventure, where patience is rewarded, and where one scoop can change your definition of dessert forever.",

Loved the smell and ambience inside and out - they produced all the ice cream in house and used specific good quality ingredients.\n\nThe peanut butter chocolate fudge is so good! We also tried the breakfast flavor - which tasted like french toast and cinnamon. Love that they have the \u2018smidge\u2019 size option which means we can sample more flavors. Opt for the cone - great taste. We also bought their chocolate fudge sauce for 50cents in a small cup and ended up scoping it while eating the ice cream to-go.\n\nGreat choice!",

It seems like this spot is busy at all times, with some people having to share tables, so just keep that in mind if you are looking for a romantic meal.\n\nWe were seated quickly and I ordered the Irish coffee (my husband  just had a beer). Being from the UK originally we are used to Irish coffees but this was a very nice version (albeit small, especially for $16). For food we ordered the lobster roll and the club sandwich, which both arrived very quickly. The lobster roll was great, with a generous portion of lobster. My husbands club sandwich looked good as well, and he said it was very tasty. His food did come with fries, which weren't mentioned on the menu or asked for, which he was ultimately charged for. It wasn't a huge amount (something like $1.50) and I would like to think it was just a mistake, but something to be aware of.\n\nWe finished our food and our server recommended a Mexican coffee, so I had to give that a try. I actually think I preferred the Mexican coffee to the Irish coffee, so if you are a Kailua fan I recommend giving it a try). In total our bill came to $130 (including tax and tip) so is a little expensive for a lunch spot. The food is good though and I would recommend if you are in the area.",

Make sure to grab a spot near the bar so you can enjoy the show.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t expect a quiet, cozy atmosphere. The Buena Vista is lively and often packed, especially on weekends and holidays. Be prepared to wait a while for a table or even a spot at the bar during peak times.

Being from the UK originally we are used to Irish coffees but this was a very nice version (albeit small, especially for $16). For food we ordered the lobster roll and the club sandwich, which both arrived very quickly. The lobster roll was great, with a generous portion of lobster. My husbands club sandwich looked good as well, and he said it was very tasty. His food did come with fries, which weren't mentioned on the menu or asked for, which he was ultimately charged for. It wasn't a huge amount (something like $1.50) and I would like to think it was just a mistake, but something to be aware of.\n\nWe finished our food and our server recommended a Mexican coffee, so I had to give that a try. I actually think I preferred the Mexican coffee to the Irish coffee, so if you are a Kailua fan I recommend giving it a try). In total our bill came to $130 (including tax and tip) so is a little expensive for a lunch spot. The food is good though and I would recommend if you are in the area.",
          "If you\u2019re in San Francisco and love a good cocktail experience, The Buena Vista is an absolute must-see - especially for anyone craving an iconic Irish Coffee. This legendary spot has perfected the art of the drink, and watching the bartenders line up glasses and craft each Irish Coffee with precision is truly mesmerizing. Make sure to grab a spot near the bar so you can enjoy the show.\n\nThat said, don\u2019t expect a quiet, cozy atmosphere. The Buena Vista is lively and often packed, especially on weekends and holidays. Be prepared to wait a while for a table or even a spot at the bar during peak times. The energy and buzz are part of the charm, though\u2014it\u2019s all part of the experience.\n\nBottom line: Come for the history, stay for the Irish Coffee, and soak in the vibrant vibe of this San Francisco classic."

The drink didn\u2019t hit at all, not even a buzz and I\u2019m a lightweight. $35 for 3 slices of cheese and meat and stiff bread is crazy work.

          "Best rooftop of SF, and don\u2019t say this lightly, I have been here for 10 years.! It is really the only one with real 360 degree views. It\u2019s spacious and really well set up. Decor section is a bit old but I\u2019ll say that\u2019s part of the charm.\nService is great. Max was hilarious and super helpful. Made us remember what good American service used to be.\nGood drink selection (very reasonable prices for SF, specially if you go by the bottle!) and not crowded\nWill be back and really enjoyed it.",
          "Attended a private event here sponsored by SF Pride and it was an amazing experience. The bar is on the top floor of the Hilton Union Square and you see amazing almost 360 views of the city and Bay! The drinks were great and the appetizers we had were delicious, especially the truffle chips and the beef empanadas. Service was friendly and professional.",
          "General vibe isn\u2019t bad for a first time experience. They did play random hip hop music that didn\u2019t seem very fitting for this kind of setting. Only got 2 things and for $60 in total, isn\u2019t worth it. The drink didn\u2019t hit at all, not even a buzz and I\u2019m a lightweight. $35 for 3 slices of cheese and meat and stiff bread is crazy work. Mind you, in my photo we had barely started picking at it. I\u2019m looking back at another person\u2019s photo of the charcuterie board in previous reviews, and it definitely did not look the same as what I received. No one was attentive the entire time we were at our table. We had to ask some random worker, not even sure if he was a server, to give us our bill which he also had the audacity to ask for us to leave a tip. But why tip when the bare minimum and expectations weren\u2019t met and literally no one worked for it.

The downstairs bar is much smaller and super packed (a little loud too), so finding a seat wasn\u2019t easy haha.\n\nThe menu was SO cute!\nWe blindly chose High Flyers and (I think) Sword Swallower. Both were really unique and surprisingly smooth! Sword Swallower was refreshing, while High Flyers was sweet but not heavy at all!\n\nWe also ordered fries and chicken nuggets \u2014 the sauces were amazing and everything was freshly fried, super crispy and juicy!\nHighly recommend grabbing a snack with your drink.\n\nThis is one of those places where I\u2019d totally come back regularly to try their new menu themes.

Honestly I'm happy I went and it for sure didn't give me the blues.  Yes the place is rustic some might call it funky but it works.  I like the big L shaped bar in the middle on which you can sit from both sides. That somehow gives you the opportunity to strike up conversations with random other guests or just enjoy the moment by yourself.\nI tried their Cesar salad Mac and Cheese and pulled pork shoulder sandwich.  I like that the pork wasn't smothered in sauce .  Sauces came on the side so to each its own.  You can bathe in them, simply dip or forgo them.\n\nThe presentation is rather smartly done.  The Caesar , oh well it's a Caesar not much to say about it.  The mac and cheese was rather tasty but could have stayed in the oven a bit longer to make it a bit less saucy.  The pulled pork was tasty. I didn't care for the brioche as it loses its texture too quickly.   I'd love to try it on a French baguette or a sourdough roll with a crust and id add gruyere.  Again the sandwich was good it just gave me ideas on how I'd try to enhance it.\n\nWell done thanks chef",

The fries are thick cut and overflowing. The Brisket sandwich itself is solid but not impressive, good quality BBQ sauces. Staff is friendly; A great place with a good value. $21 for the Brisket Sando and fries. They also serve a diverse selection of Craft beer. Friendly staff, great beer selection all in cans and therefore overpriced. $9 pint cans of craft SF beers. The brisket combo plate was good, the sauces carried the meal.. for SF solid BBQ, relatively appropriately priced. Not s place that will impress you by any means. But a Solid option",

But the craving hit hard, so I ordered \u00bc lb pulled pork, \u00bd lb brisket, the Texas beef rib, and their mac & cheese. Everything was delicious!\n\nThe brisket stole the show: smoky, flavorful, and so tender I regretted not ordering a full pound. The Texas beef rib was a fun adventure\u2014huge, meaty, and nicely smoked. I don\u2019t usually eat beef ribs back home, but the Texan in me had to try it. Leftovers even made the perfect breakfast with eggs.\n\nPulled pork was flavorful and juicy\u2014I skipped the sandwich so I could taste the meat on its own. (Pro tip: it\u2019s just as good the next day in a quick sandwich.) And the mac & cheese? Creamy, cheesy perfection; true to the South. It could have been my #1, but I didn\u2019t want to overshadow the BBQ. Leftovers from this meal fed me two more times\u2014I basically walked out feeling like I got away with a steal.\n\nA special shoutout to Jackie, the manager that night. She had the kind of warmth and hospitality that makes you feel like you\u2019ve known her forever. She even indulged my Texan request for pickles with my BBQ (no judgment here!) and walked me through their sauces\u2014each one worth trying, especially if you mix them for fun flavor combos.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019ll be back. Next time I\u2019ll try more of their menu (and fingers crossed for peach cobbler!). If you\u2019re anywhere nearby, it\u2019s worth the trip. They blend Southern BBQ beautifully\u2014and yes, this Texas girl gives it a thumbs up.\n\nAlso, the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant is through and through a Southern vibe! IYKYK",

            "text": "So I finally decided to try this place. I tried out the sausage plate with a chile verde cheddar pork sausage that comes with rice & beans and cornbread. The flavor of the sausage was delicious but some of my beans were undercooked and hard. I thought the cornbread was horrible and lacked that cornbread texture and flavor. For a $27.16 price tag with a drink I was highly disappointed with only two small sausages. That was definitely not $30 worth of food or service when the guy played dominoes the whole time I was there with a customer. I highly doubt I will try anything else from here again!",

          "I'm not typically going for a BBQ joint but I think the warm weather or the moon position sort gave me the feeling of trying Baby Blues.  Honestly I'm happy I went and it for sure didn't give me the blues.  Yes the place is rustic some might call it funky but it works.  I like the big L shaped bar in the middle on which you can sit from both sides. That somehow gives you the opportunity to strike up conversations with random other guests or just enjoy the moment by yourself.\nI tried their Cesar salad Mac and Cheese and pulled pork shoulder sandwich.  I like that the pork wasn't smothered in sauce .  Sauces came on the side so to each its own.  You can bathe in them, simply dip or forgo them.\n\nThe presentation is rather smartly done.  The Caesar , oh well it's a Caesar not much to say about it.  The mac and cheese was rather tasty but could have stayed in the oven a bit longer to make it a bit less saucy.  The pulled pork was tasty. I didn't care for the brioche as it loses its texture too quickly.   I'd love to try it on a French baguette or a sourdough roll with a crust and id add gruyere.  Again the sandwich was good it just gave me ideas on how I'd try to enhance it.\n\nWell done thanks chef",
          "Solid lunch option for this region of SF ~ Good, not great BBQ in SF. Very clean and inviting bbq joint with TV's.  One of the few places around open at noon for lunch. The fries are thick cut and overflowing. The Brisket sandwich itself is solid but not impressive, good quality BBQ sauces. Staff is friendly; A great place with a good value. $21 for the Brisket Sando and fries. They also serve a diverse selection of Craft beer. Friendly staff, great beer selection all in cans and therefore overpriced. $9 pint cans of craft SF beers. The brisket combo plate was good, the sauces carried the meal.. for SF solid BBQ, relatively appropriately priced. Not s place that will impress you by any means. But a Solid option",
          "Being from Austin, TX, I know good BBQ\u2014and I\u2019ll admit, I was skeptical about trying it away from home. But the craving hit hard, so I ordered \u00bc lb pulled pork, \u00bd lb brisket, the Texas beef rib, and their mac & cheese. Everything was delicious!\n\nThe brisket stole the show: smoky, flavorful, and so tender I regretted not ordering a full pound. The Texas beef rib was a fun adventure\u2014huge, meaty, and nicely smoked. I don\u2019t usually eat beef ribs back home, but the Texan in me had to try it. Leftovers even made the perfect breakfast with eggs.\n\nPulled pork was flavorful and juicy\u2014I skipped the sandwich so I could taste the meat on its own. (Pro tip: it\u2019s just as good the next day in a quick sandwich.) And the mac & cheese? Creamy, cheesy perfection; true to the South. It could have been my #1, but I didn\u2019t want to overshadow the BBQ. Leftovers from this meal fed me two more times\u2014I basically walked out feeling like I got away with a steal.\n\nA special shoutout to Jackie, the manager that night. She had the kind of warmth and hospitality that makes you feel like you\u2019ve known her forever. She even indulged my Texan request for pickles with my BBQ (no judgment here!) and walked me through their sauces\u2014each one worth trying, especially if you mix them for fun flavor combos.\n\nBottom line: I\u2019ll be back. Next time I\u2019ll try more of their menu (and fingers crossed for peach cobbler!). If you\u2019re anywhere nearby, it\u2019s worth the trip. They blend Southern BBQ beautifully\u2014and yes, this Texas girl gives it a thumbs up.\n\nAlso, the atmosphere/ambiance of the restaurant is through and through a Southern vibe! IYKYK"

I had been missing all the great food from back home especially some brisket, it seems California only serves tri-tip. I heard about this place and decided to make a trip to SF. When we pulled up I saw the sign \"Texas Style\" and was hoping to get exactly that. When we walked up to the restaurant it definitely smelled like home, something about that Texas Style BBQ that just hits you different. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and asked if we had any questions. We looked at the menu for a few moments and decided to order brisket, ribs, Mac n cheese, cornbread, hot link, and potato salad. They were sold out of hot links and potato salad, that was the third sign we were in the right place for some delicious food. We got our food and it was definitely more generous than what we ordered, no complaints there! We started to dive into the brisket and ribs and as soon as that brisket hit my taste buds I felt like I was home! The brisket was cooked perfectly and seasoned well, bark was on point too! The ribs were also amazing no sauce needed for either the brisket or ribs, they do give you some but its not needed even though the sauce was delicious too it only got used one time then it was just back to the meat by itself. The cornbread definitely was Texas style too with the small pieces of jalapeno in it, very good and not dry like most cornbread. The Mac n cheese was good too! The owners run the place and do most the work themselves so you know there is a lot of care put into what comes out of that kitchen! I didn't realize how homesick I was until we got there and well after I felt rejuvenated and like there was some piece of home here in California. Turns out the owner is from Houston Texas and thats why its so good. They said they started out just as pop up selling here and there but then people got a hold of their food and well now they habe this great location locked down a few minutes drive from Peir 39. What a wonderful place to eat and enjoy a great family owned restaurant! We will definitely be back here soon, the 1 1/2+ drive from Hollister is definitely worth this experience, yes the food is definitely an experience that you need in your life. Good food makes me happy and this did more than that being so far from home! Oh sorry I was day dreaming about that brisket and ribs.....don't forget to order your banana brulee bliss we almost did but we did get one and it was amazing too! Definitely a must have, my girlfriend doesn't even like bananas and she loved this dessert!",

            "text": "So I saw this place on TikTok and the food looked so good so I just had to give a try. So I came by with my mom and we were super excited, especially considering we came on the weekend where the Dino rib was available. My mom spent about $200 worth of stuff! We ended up ordering six bao buns half-and-half(9/10) the Dino rib(2/10) the smoked brisket (3/10), smoked brisket grilled cheese sandwich,(7/10) and the regular brisket sandwich(6/10) and the mac & cheese(4/10)To be honest, the food was a major disappointment. The Dino rib was the way smaller than the one they showed on TikTok and it had absolutely zero flavor. It tasted like I was eating air. The beef brisket was two pieces for $20 outrageous pricing and it also had no flavor. I feel like this restaurant relies on barbecue sauce for flavor and not salt/ seasonings. The mac & cheese had zero seasoning and was so bland and the macaroni noodles were like five minutes overcooked super mushy. The regular brisket sandwich was dry according to my mom however, the brisket grilled cheese was pretty good however I feel like they were over relying on barbecue sauce once again, but I will give that sandwich a seven out of 10. The best thing we had was the spicy bao bun and we would give that a nine out of 10. overall, I think this place is overhyped and I probably will not come back. also, the lady at the register was very passive aggressive and it just made the whole experience worse. She was so extra about 50 cents for barbecue sauce . We were also like the only people really there and our food took what felt like forever. And they kept saying that the wait it would be worth it, but it wasn\u2019t.",

Skewers are all absolutely delicious, my favorite is the original pork sausage skewer, so juicy and fatty just like the sausages in Taiwan. The beef skewer was also so beefy, amazing. The chicken gristle is also my favorite, pair that with rice and that can be a meal in it of itself\n\nI can\u2019t wait to come back and try even more skewers.",

This is not how I respond to MSG (usually get a migraine)- something was spoiled, and I cant find a phone number to report the issue! Moral- only get sushi/waygu tartar at sushi places.  The health department did report visiting the restaurant and finding violations that needed to be remedied immediately- and I still have not found a way to contact the restaurant myself.\n\n Everything has MSG, even the rice.  The scallops (or green onion?) were really sandy. I got the waygu tartar (was the best plate I got), scallop hotate and tuna garlic hand roll because they had \"low msg.\"  Tuna was super fishy, would not get again . Staff was nice, sour beer really good, and presentation was pretty.  I ate it all and am not a big eater, bill was $70.

Mango flavor ice cream so good. The Atmosphere is very simple but great with soft music in the background was easy to listen to it while enjoying the ramen soup. The beer the didn\u2019t have bottle only tap but it was ok. Most places I tried tab beer usually is flat (I am guessing no service to their equipment) it was ok. The only thing I didn\u2019t like it was the SERVICE DINE IN FEE (18%) which it is a force tip embedded in your bill. Also, the fact that you have to pay at front before even trying the food I think is too much. When I asked Benny about the extra charge he said \u201c we charge the dine-in fee so we don\u2019t ask tips from customers\u201d however, I think I dine out several times and this was a forced tip at front before you even get your food. I didn\u2019t like it. Restaurant that they do this things under different labels I think they shooting themselves in the foot, cause according to the service I can even tip 30%.

          "Ramen noodles done great!!!! I have tried this place in my trip the food was superb. At the end I got a courtesy ice cream to finish the night out. Mango flavor ice cream so good. The Atmosphere is very simple but great with soft music in the background was easy to listen to it while enjoying the ramen soup. The beer the didn\u2019t have bottle only tap but it was ok. Most places I tried tab beer usually is flat (I am guessing no service to their equipment) it was ok. The only thing I didn\u2019t like it was the SERVICE DINE IN FEE (18%) which it is a force tip embedded in your bill. Also, the fact that you have to pay at front before even trying the food I think is too much. When I asked Benny about the extra charge he said \u201c we charge the dine-in fee so we don\u2019t ask tips from customers\u201d however, I think I dine out several times and this was a forced tip at front before you even get your food. I didn\u2019t like it. Restaurant that they do this things under different labels I think they shooting themselves in the foot, cause according to the service I can even tip 30%. However it\u2019s just me.",
          "Food is awesome! Great ramen and very tasty! We are just thankful so much to the Indonesian Server who was very patient with us from dropping our chopsticks to spilling glass of water. That man deserves a raise. Kudos. Recommended for Ramen",

Gave us recommendations and answered our questions; and staff was so attentive!\nI ordered the vegan creamy broth ramen. It was good; however, I liked Hinodeya\u2019s better as theirs was more creamy and I liked the taste better. Marufuku\u2019s was still good though.\nMy friend had the Hankata Tonkatsu DX (The DX just means it has extra toppings). Apparently, this is one of the popular dishes. He said it was really good. We both finished our ramen so highly recommend.\nWe ordered the chicken Karaage as well. I have to say this was SO good!!! For those wondering, I know I ordered the vegan ramen but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t eat that much meat (obviously not 100% vegan or vegetarian).\nStreet parking can be tough but you if you\u2019re lucky, you can find free residential parking or metered parking. Otherwise, there is an underground paid parking garage. If you take public transportation, the 38-Geary or 22-Fillmore (you\u2019ll have to walk a few blocks, not bad as there\u2019s plenty of shops & restaurants along the way).\nI highly recommend this place!",

The broth was sublime as expected, the noodles perfectly al dente (small thin) with really tender pieces of pork. It was delicious and service was excellent but it was sooo noisy inside? It was hard to talk but for this incredible ramen, it\u2019s worth it!!",
          "I\u2019ve heard about this place for a while and finally had the unexpected opportunity on Christmas Eve. A friend and I decided to meet at Japantown for dinner. We walked around and I remembered this place. We decided to eat here. We didn\u2019t even have to wait 5 mins and we were called to our table! Our waitress was SO nice! She was above & beyond! Gave us recommendations and answered our questions; and staff was so attentive!\nI ordered the vegan creamy broth ramen. It was good; however, I liked Hinodeya\u2019s better as theirs was more creamy and I liked the taste better. Marufuku\u2019s was still good though.\nMy friend had the Hankata Tonkatsu DX (The DX just means it has extra toppings). Apparently, this is one of the popular dishes. He said it was really good. We both finished our ramen so highly recommend.\nWe ordered the chicken Karaage as well. I have to say this was SO good!!! For those wondering, I know I ordered the vegan ramen but it\u2019s because I don\u2019t eat that much meat (obviously not 100% vegan or vegetarian).\nStreet parking can be tough but you if you\u2019re lucky, you can find free residential parking or metered parking. Otherwise, there is an underground paid parking garage. If you take public transportation, the 38-Geary or 22-Fillmore (you\u2019ll have to walk a few blocks, not bad as there\u2019s plenty of shops & restaurants along the way).\nI highly recommend this place!",
          "Marufuku Ramen SF absolutely delivers! The tonkotsu broth is rich and silky, the noodles have that perfect bite, and the chashu melts in your mouth. Even when the place is busy, the staff is friendly and efficient, making the whole experience smooth and enjoyable. The karaage chicken is a must\u2011order side, and portions are generous enough to leave you satisfied but wanting to come back. Easily one of the better ramen spots in San Francisco!"

My group arrived around 3:51pm and we were around the 4th group inside. Service was surprisingly super quick. I ordered the Spicy Signature Toripaitan and it came out in less than 5 minutes. This started off being one of the best ramens I\u2019ve ever had. But unfortunately, about a quarter of the way through my bowl, I found a hair in it. It was most definitely not my hair. I didn\u2019t want to make a scene, so I didn\u2019t mention it to the staff, but I immediately lost my appetite. A family member ended up eating the rest of my bowl. I do have a photo for reference. I understand that mistakes can happen, but it was disappointing and affected what had been an otherwise great experience.",

            "text": "Ramenwell in San Francisco's Mission district offers a convenient option for a ramen fix, but be aware of a few things before you go.\n\nFirst, online reservations come with a $5 charge per person. This charge gets applied to your final bill, so double-check it to avoid paying extra. They also have a strict policy of not seating incomplete parties, so make sure your whole group arrives before you get hangry. The good news is that you can chill at their bar with a drink while you wait (given that they have the bar seating available)\n\nThe service itself is fast, and our server was friendly and helpful. However, the appetizers were a bit of a letdown. Both the chicken katsu and the takoyaki were lukewarm, which definitely affected the enjoyment factor. The katsu itself was decent, with one good sauce and one overly sour one. The takoyaki, on the other hand, were a bit too doughy for our liking.\n\nTheir signature pork ramen was a bit on the pricey side, and overall, it was just okay. The noodles were firm and flavorful, but customization seems limited. If you prefer softer noodles, you might be disappointed.  The pork slices were thicker than the usual chashu cuts and a bit dry on the edges. The normal spice level was barely there, so spice lovers should definitely go for level 5 or higher.\nThe broth was quite flavorful for what it's worth.\n\nThe constant flow of customers coming in and out created a busy atmosphere, but it wasn't overly loud or chaotic.\n\nRamenwell offers a decent ramen experience with friendly service and a convenient location.  However, the lukewarm appetizers, limited customization options, and slightly higher price point prevent it from being a standout.",
