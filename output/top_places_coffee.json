Really loved the calm vibe, and the espresso. It was smooth, not burnt at all, strong and great tasting notes.\n\nCan\u2019t say enough good things, this place is solid and and I get why they have a perfect score.",

I will not be returning to Pinhole even though i love their atmosphere and the arts and the coffee is fairly good.\n\nI walked from 16th & Valencia in the Mission all the way to Pinhole in Bernal Heights to get my long walk in and to get coffee cause I\u2019m a recent fan and love their coffee & vibes. I ordered my usual - oat milk latte which costs $6.75 and $7.25 with the small tip I added and their cup size is smaller compared to some other coffee shops with similar vibes in the Mission. They were swamped when i arrived around 10-10.30am on Sunday and i waited in line and once my coffee was ready to pick up it wasn\u2019t filled all the way so I asked them if they could add more coffee and they said no and said it\u2019d be $2 for another shot of coffee.\n\nThen i protested cause let\u2019s be real who wants to pay now $9.25 for a fairly small latte to be able to get an extra shot?! Sure we live in one of the most expensive cities in the country and pretty much the world but this is not a coffee shop in a swanky resort in Vegas or Arizona. I understand the small businesses in SF are struggling and need to keep their costs in check but STOP passing the burden to the end customer. I REFUSE to pay $9.25 for my smallest in town oat milk latte.\n\nSo unfortunately, I will not be returning to Pinhole and I will go to Progressive Grounds which is a Bernal Heights original/ old school coffee shop. Let\u2019s support more small businesses that are not ig-famous and spoiled but old school SF and trying to survive and even then offer superb customer service!\n\nNote: Photo is after i bought the latte but haven\u2019t drank it yet for 3-5 min and the ice already melted quite a bit.",

Thanks Pinhole, I visit you every time I\u2019m in town.",
          "I was about to become a regular at Pinhole Coffee and then had a bad incident yesterday so unfortunately it turned me against the coffee shop. I will not be returning to Pinhole even though i love their atmosphere and the arts and the coffee is fairly good.\n\nI walked from 16th & Valencia in the Mission all the way to Pinhole in Bernal Heights to get my long walk in and to get coffee cause I\u2019m a recent fan and love their coffee & vibes. I ordered my usual - oat milk latte which costs $6.75 and $7.25 with the small tip I added and their cup size is smaller compared to some other coffee shops with similar vibes in the Mission. They were swamped when i arrived around 10-10.30am on Sunday and i waited in line and once my coffee was ready to pick up it wasn\u2019t filled all the way so I asked them if they could add more coffee and they said no and said it\u2019d be $2 for another shot of coffee.\n\nThen i protested cause let\u2019s be real who wants to pay now $9.25 for a fairly small latte to be able to get an extra shot?! Sure we live in one of the most expensive cities in the country and pretty much the world but this is not a coffee shop in a swanky resort in Vegas or Arizona. I understand the small businesses in SF are struggling and need to keep their costs in check but STOP passing the burden to the end customer. I REFUSE to pay $9.25 for my smallest in town oat milk latte.\n\nSo unfortunately, I will not be returning to Pinhole and I will go to Progressive Grounds which is a Bernal Heights original/ old school coffee shop. Let\u2019s support more small businesses that are not ig-famous and spoiled but old school SF and trying to survive and even then offer superb customer service!\n\nNote: Photo is after i bought the latte but haven\u2019t drank it yet for 3-5 min and the ice already melted quite a bit.",
          "my favorite coffee shop in san francisco. the pastries are delicious, love the peanut butter cookie & mochi pastry. i enjoyed the expresso here & americano. \u2615\ufe0f staff is friendly. aesthetically unique, love the wooden furniture & the art work."

The service was friendly, helpful and fast. they offered a variety of drinks and pastries but you can also find souvenirs, magazines, tea, coffee, merchandise and more. The place is very spacious and has a few tables inside and an outdoor area. We order a golden iced kate and one iced chai latte. The drinks were flavorful without being overwhelming.All the right flavors were there, the pastries were also good. The price is on the higher end but I would love to come back since the vibe and product received are worth it.",

They had SO MANY cool options for making coffee at home, which they also sell beans (that are collaboratively roasted) by the pound! Highly recommend.\n*3/2024\nFarley's always delivers a wonderful experience, honey almond milk latte is my new favorite \u2728",

When it was our turn, we ordered four slices, cheese, pepperoni, combo, and sausage.\nThe pepperoni has a hint of spicy that set it off completely. The cheese was cheesy and delicious. The sausage was tasty, but that COMBO ONE... by far the best one! It had a hint of sweet, spicy, and crunchy. Next time I am in SF, I will definitely be going back. It's worth the wait.",

          "Famous pizza place in the heart of SF won\u2019t disappoint! Get ready to stay in line for a bit but it moves fast and trust me, it\u2019s worth the wait! $4 avg price for a slice of pizza? Unheard of these days!\n\nThe square was good size and delish.",
          "I first saw this place on tiktok. Thought about it, but I never come to SF to even imagine trying it. Well, a fate brought me right around the corner and figured it was time. When we saw the long line, we knew it would be amazing. It did take a minute to get to order, but only because the folks in front were ordering pies (genius). When it was our turn, we ordered four slices, cheese, pepperoni, combo, and sausage.\nThe pepperoni has a hint of spicy that set it off completely. The cheese was cheesy and delicious. The sausage was tasty, but that COMBO ONE... by far the best one! It had a hint of sweet, spicy, and crunchy. Next time I am in SF, I will definitely be going back. It's worth the wait.",

From the moment I walked in, I was greeted by the smell of fresh pizza and a visually striking interior. The experience was overwhelmingly positive, combining delicious food, quality ingredients, and a funky artistic decor that made the visit memorable. Yes, the price tag was a bit high (around $60 for our meal), but I left feeling it was absolutely worth it for the quality and overall experience. Here\u2019s a breakdown of my visit:\n- Pepperoni Pizza (Slice): Incredibly delicious, with a perfect thin crust that had a nice crunch on the outside and a chewy center. The pepperoni was savory and crispy around the edges, and you could taste the quality of the ingredients \u2013 from the tangy tomato sauce to the gooey, rich cheese. Each bite was bursting with flavor, and the slice was generous in size.\n- Meatball Sub: A hearty sandwich overflowing with tender, flavorful meatballs and melted cheese. The bread was toasted just right \u2013 crunchy on the outside but soft inside, soaking up the savory marinara sauce. It\u2019s the kind of comfort food that hits the spot; rich in flavor and clearly made with love and good ingredients.\nBoth items were freshly made to order and served hot. We could immediately tell the difference that quality ingredients make \u2013 nothing tasted processed or bland. For example, the tomato sauce on the pizza and sub had a homemade taste with herbs and natural sweetness, and the meats were lean and well-seasoned.",

While the cheese is almost fried onto the sides making it chewy and crispy. The toppings a generous and stacked. We got seated right away at the bar with no reservations. Pizza came out quick and hot. This place ranks way above Square Pie Guys for me. Oh and the hot sauce was also fire - tangy, complimentary and spicy.",

I also fell in love with their house made hot sauce. It added to the flavor of the Pepperoni and just tied everything together. Absolutely hit the spot. We can't wait to come back!",

            "text": "Phenomenal. It was our first time here and didn't really know what to expect. It was packed for a Thursday night so we sat outside and ordered a pizza and the Nashville spicy chicken sliders. Both were extremely fresh and had a great flavor. The pizza was my favorite. We got a basic pepperoni but it was the star of the night. The dough of this pizza is fantastic and paired with their house made hot sauce.... STELLER. We Will definitely be coming back to try different items and next time we will try one of the many a craft beers they offer. Thank you for the great service, the atmosphere, and mostly the great food!",
